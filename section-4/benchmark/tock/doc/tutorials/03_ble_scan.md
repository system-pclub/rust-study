Look! A Wild BLE Packet Appeared!
=================================

This tutorial will walk you through getting an app running that scans
for BLE advertisements. Most BLE devices typically broadcast advertisements
periodically (usually once a second) to allow smartphones and other devices
to discover them. The advertisements typically contain the BLE device's ID
and name, as well as as which services the device provides, and sometimes
raw data as well.

To provide BLE connectivity, several Tock boards use the Nordic nRF51822
as a BLE co-processor. In this configuration, the nRF51822 runs all of
the BLE operations and exposes a command interface over a UART bus. Luckily for
us, Nordic has defined and implemented the entire interface. Better yet, they
made it interoperable with their nRF51 SDK. What this means is any BLE app
that would run on the nRF51822 directly can be compiled to run on a different
microcontroller, and any function calls that would have interacted with
the BLE hardware are instead packaged and sent to the nRF51822 co-processor.
Nordic calls this tool "BLE Serialization", and Tock has a port of the
serialization libraries that Tock applications can use.

So, with that introduction, lets get going.

1. **Initialize the BLE co-processor**. The first step a BLE serialization
app must do is initialize the BLE stack on the co-processor. This can be
done with Nordic's SDK, but to simplify things Tock supports the
[Simple BLE](https://github.com/lab11/nrf5x-base/tree/master/lib) library.
The goal of `simple_ble.c` is to wrap the details of the nRF5 SDK and the
intricacies of BLE in an easy-to-use library so you can get going with creating
BLE devices and not learning the entire spec.


    ```c
    #include <simple_ble.h>

    // Intervals for advertising and connections.
    // These are some basic settings for BLE devices. However, since we are
    // only interesting in scanning, these are not particularly relevant.
    simple_ble_config_t ble_config = {
      .platform_id       = 0x00, // used as 4th octet in device BLE address
      .device_id         = DEVICE_ID_DEFAULT,
      .adv_name          = "Tock",
      .adv_interval      = MSEC_TO_UNITS(500, UNIT_0_625_MS),
      .min_conn_interval = MSEC_TO_UNITS(1000, UNIT_1_25_MS),
      .max_conn_interval = MSEC_TO_UNITS(1250, UNIT_1_25_MS)
    };

    int main () {
        printf("[Tutorial] BLE Scanning\n");

        // Setup BLE.
        simple_ble_init(&ble_config);
    }
    ```

2. **Scan for advertisements**. With `simple_ble` this is pretty
straightforward.

    ```c
    int main () {
        printf("[Tutorial] BLE Scanning\n");

        // Setup BLE.
        simple_ble_init(&ble_config);

        // Scan for advertisements.
        simple_ble_scan_start();
    }
    ```

3. **Handle the advertisement received event**. Just as the main Tock
microcontroller can send commands to the nRF co-processor, the co-processor
can send events back. When these occur, a variety of callbacks are generated
in `simple_ble` and then passed to users of the library. In this case, we
only care about `ble_evt_adv_report()` which is called on each advertisement
reception.

    ```c
    // Called when each advertisement is received.
    void ble_evt_adv_report (ble_evt_t* p_ble_evt) {
      ble_gap_evt_adv_report_t* adv = (ble_gap_evt_adv_report_t*) &p_ble_evt->evt.gap_evt.params.adv_report;
    }
    ```

    The `ble_evt_adv_report()` function is passed a pointer to a `ble_evt_t`
    struct. This is a type from the Nordic nRF51 SDK, and more information
    can be found in the SDK documentation.

4. **Display a message for each advertisement**. Once we have the advertisement
callback, we can use `printf()` like normal.

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    #include <led.h>

    // Called when each advertisement is received.
    void ble_evt_adv_report (ble_evt_t* p_ble_evt) {
      ble_gap_evt_adv_report_t* adv = (ble_gap_evt_adv_report_t*) &p_ble_evt->evt.gap_evt.params.adv_report;

      // Print some details about the discovered advertisement.
      printf("Recv Advertisement: [%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x] RSSI: %d, Len: %d\n",
        adv->peer_addr.addr[5], adv->peer_addr.addr[4], adv->peer_addr.addr[3],
        adv->peer_addr.addr[2], adv->peer_addr.addr[1], adv->peer_addr.addr[0],
        adv->rssi, adv->dlen);

      // Also toggle the first LED.
      led_toggle(0);
    }
    ```

5. **Handle some BLE annoyances**. The last step to getting a working app
is to handle some annoyances using BLE serialization with the `simple_ble`
library. Typically errors generated by the nRF51 SDK are severe and mean
there is a significant bug in the code. With serialization, however,
messages between the two processors can be corrupted or misframed, causing
parsing errors. We can ignore these errors safely and just drop the corrupted
packet.

    Additionally, the `simple_ble` library makes it easy to set the address
    of a BLE device. However, this functionality only works when running
    on an actual nRF51822. To disable this, we override the weakly defined
    `ble_address_set()` function with an empty function.

    ```c
    void app_error_fault_handler(uint32_t error_code, uint32_t line_num, uint32_t info) { }
    void ble_address_set () { }
    ```

6. **Run the app and see the packets!** To try this tutorial application, you
   can find it in the [tutorials app
   folder](https://github.com/tock/libtock-c/tree/master/examples/tutorials/03_ble_scan).

    For any new applications, ensure that the following is in the makefile
    so that the BLE serialization library is included.

        include $(TOCK_USERLAND_BASE_DIR)/libnrfserialization/Makefile.app

This section contains a few notes about the specific versions of BLE
serialization used.

Tock currently supports the S130 softdevice version 2.0.0 and SDK 11.0.0.
