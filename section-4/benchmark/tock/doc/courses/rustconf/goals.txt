At the end of the RustConf tutorial, attendees should be able to:

1) Set up a Hail board, compile Tock, install Tock, compile applications,
   and install applications.

2) Add a new capsule to the kernel (write it, include it in the crate,
   initialize it in a boot sequence).

3) Write a system call interface to a capsule.

4) Write a new chip driver for a hardware controller.
   - Maybe not, but understanding unsafe use here is important.
   - If not, maybe _modify_ a controller driver

5) Write down/diagram what happens when a process makes a blocking
   system call (context switch, interrupt setup, wait_for, interrupt 
   handling, kernel thread, resuming process).
