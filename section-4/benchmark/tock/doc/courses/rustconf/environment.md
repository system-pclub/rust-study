# Tock OS Course Part 1: Getting your environment set up

The goal of this part of the course is to make sure you have a working
development environment for Tock.

During this you will:

- Get a high-level overview of how Tock works.
- Learn how to compile and flash the kernel onto a Hail board.

## 1. Presentation: Tock's goals, architecture and components

The key contribution of Tock is that it uses Rust's borrow checker as a
language sandbox for isolation and a cooperative scheduling model for
concurrency in the kernel.  As a result, isolation is (more or less) free in
terms of resource consumption at the expense of preemptive scheduling (so a
malicious component could block the system by, e.g., spinning in an infinite
loop). This is accomplished by the following architecture:

![Tock architecture](architecture.png)

Tock includes three architectural components:

  - A small trusted kernel, written in Rust, that implements a hardware
    abstraction layer (HAL), scheduler, and platform-specific configuration.
  - _Capsules_, which are compiled with the kernel and use Rust's type and
    module systems for safety.
  - _Processes_, which use the MPU for protection at runtime.

Read the Tock documentation for more details on its
[design](https://www.tockos.org/documentation/design).

## 2. Check your understanding

1. What kinds of binaries exist on a Tock board? Hint: There are three, and
   only two can be programmed using `tockloader`.

2. What are the differences between capsules and processes? What performance
   and memory overhead does each entail? Why would you choose to write
   something as a process instead of a capsule and vice versa?

3. Clearly, the kernel should never enter an infinite loop. But is it
   acceptable for a process to spin? What about a capsule?

## 3. Compile and flash the kernel

### Build the kernel

To build the kernel, just type make in the root directory, or in boards/hail/.

    $ cd boards/hail/
    $ make

If this is the first time you are trying to make the kernel, cargo and rustup
will now go ahead and install all the requirements of Tock.

If you're not in a board folder,
the root Makefile selects a board and architecture to build the kernel for and
routes all calls to that board's specific Makefile. It's set up with
`TOCK_BOARD ?= hail`, so it compiles for the Hail board by default. To change
this default, just change the `TOCK_BOARD` environment variable. For example,
to compile for the imix instead, `export TOCK_BOARD=imix` or `cd boards/imix/`.

### Connect to a Hail board

> On Linux, you might need to give your user access to the Hail's serial port. You can do this by adding a udev rule in:
> `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-hail` containing the rule: `ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6015", MODE="0666"`.
> Detaching and re-attaching Hail should do the trick.

To connect your development machine to the Hail, connect them with a micro-USB
cable. Any cable will do. Hail should come with the Tock kernel and the Hail
test app pre-loaded. When you plug in Hail, the blue LED should blink slowly
(about once per second). Pressing the User Button—just to the right of the USB
plug—should turn on the green LED.

The Hail board should appear as a regular serial device (e.g.
/dev/tty.usbserial-c098e5130006 on my machine). While you can connect with any
standard serial program (set to 115200 baud), tockloader makes this easier.
Tockloader can read attributes from connected serial devices, and will
automatically find your connected Hail. Simply run:

    $ tockloader listen
    No device name specified. Using default "tock"
    Using "/dev/ttyUSB0 - Hail IoT Module - TockOS"

    Listening for serial output.

    [Hail] Test App!
    [Hail] Samples all sensors.
    [Hail] Transmits name over BLE.
    [Hail] Button controls LED.
    [Hail Sensor Reading]
      Temperature:  3174 1/100 degrees C
      Humidity:     3915 0.01%
      Light:        15
      Acceleration: 987
    ...

### Flash the kernel

Now that the Hail board is connected and you have verified that the kernel
compiles, we can flash the Hail board with the latest Tock kernel:

    $ make program

This command will compile the kernel if needed, and then use `tockloader` to
flash it onto the Hail. When the flash command succeeds, the Hail test app
should no longer be working (i.e. the blue LED will not be blinking). Instead,
the red LED will be blinking furiously, a sign that the kernel has panicked.

Don't panic! This is because...

### Clear out the applications and re-flash the test app.

...the Tock Binary Format (TBF) was recently changed, and is incompatible with the
app pre-loaded on the Hail board. To fix this, clear it out and re-flash it.

    $ tockloader list
    ...
    [App 0]
      Name:                  hail
      Total Size in Flash:   65536 bytes
    ...

As you can see, the old Hail test app is still installed on the board. This
also nicely demonstrates that user applications are nicely isolated from the
kernel: it is possible to update one independently of the other. Remove it with
the following command:

    $ tockloader erase-apps

The red LED should no longer blink. Compile and re-flash the Hail test app:

    $ cd userland/examples/tests/hail/
    $ make program

You now have the bleeding-edge Tock kernel running on your Hail board!

## 4. (Optional) Familiarize yourself with `tockloader` commands
The `tockloader` tool is a useful and versatile tool for managing and installing
applications on Tock. It supports a number of commands, and a more complete
list can be found in the tockloader repository, located at
https://github.com/tock/tockloader. Below is a list of the more useful
and important commands for programming and querying a board.

### `tockloader install`
This is the main tockloader command, used to load Tock applications onto a
board. Use the `--no-replace` flag to install multiple copies of the same app.
In order to install an app, navigate to the correct directory, make the program,
then issue the install command:

    $ cd tock/userland/examples/blink
    $ make
    $ tockloader install

> *Tip:* You can add the `--make` flag to have tockloader automatically
> run make before installing, i.e. `tockloader install --make`

### `tockloader uninstall [application name(s)]`
Removes one or more applications from the board by name.

### `tockloader erase-apps`
Removes all applications from the board.

### `tockloader list`
Prints basic information about the apps currently loaded onto the board.

### `tockloader info`
Shows all properties of the board, including information about currently
loaded applications, their sizes and versions, and any set attributes.

### `tockloader listen`
This command prints output from Tock apps to the terminal. It listens via UART,
and will print out anything written to stdout/stderr from a board.

> *Tip:* As a long-running command, `listen` interacts with other tockloader
> sessions. You can leave a terminal window open and listening. If another
> tockloader process needs access to the board (e.g. to install an app update),
> tockloader will automatically pause and resume listening.

### `tockloader flash`
Loads binaries onto hardware platforms that are running a compatible bootloader.
This is used by the Tock Make system when kernel binaries are programmed to the
board with `make program`.

## 5. (Optional) Explore other Tock example applications

Other applications can be found in the `userland/examples/` directory. Try
loading them on your Hail and then try modifying them. By default,
`tockloader install` adds the new application, but does not erase any others.
Not all applications will work well together if they need the same resources.

> *Tip:* You can add the `--erase` flag to have tockloader automatically
> remove other applications when installing a new one.
