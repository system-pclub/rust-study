Tock courses
==================

Courses are a great way to start learning Tock. They take you to the entire
process of getting started, writing an application, and adding a capsule to the
kernel. There are currently three different courses available, corresponding to
the three conferences we've given workshops at:

- **[RustConf](rustconf)** - For the user familiar with Rust.
- **[Sensys](2018-11-SenSys)** - For the user familiar with embedded networked sensor systems.
- **[SOSP](sosp)** - For the user familiar with operating systems.
