'''
Script to generate a table of which HILs each Tock chip supports. Adds it
to the `chips/README.md` file.

Example:
```
| HIL                    | cc26x2 | nrf51 | nrf52 | sam4l | tm4c129x |
|------------------------|--------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| AES128                 |        |       | ✓     | ✓     |          |
| AES128CBC              |        |       |       | ✓     |          |
| AES128Ctr              |        |       | ✓     | ✓     |          |
| Adc                    |        |       | ✓     | ✓     |          |
