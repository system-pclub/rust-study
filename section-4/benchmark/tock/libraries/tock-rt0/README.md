tock-rt0
========

Generic helpers to support the setup of initial runtime (`rt0`).

Currently has support for data segment relocation and zero-initialization of BSS.


Stability
---------

This is a relatively new library and thus subject to change. It is also, however,
a fairly simple library and thus less likely to see significant change.
