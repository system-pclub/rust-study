//! System call interface for userspace applications.
//!
//! Drivers implement these interfaces to expose operations to applications.
//!
//! # System-call Overview
//!
//! Tock supports four system calls. The `yield` system call is handled entirely
//! by the scheduler, while three others are passed along to drivers:
//!
//!   * `subscribe` lets an application pass a callback to the driver to be
//!   called later, when an event has occurred or data of interest is available.
//!
//!   * `command` tells the driver to do something immediately.
//!
//!   * `allow` provides the driver access to an application buffer.
//!
//! ## Mapping system-calls to drivers
//!
//! Each of these three system calls takes at least two parameters. The first is
//! a _driver major number_ and tells the scheduler which driver to forward the
//! system call to. The second parameters is a _driver minor number_ and is used
//! by the driver to differentiate system calls with different driver-specific
//! meanings (e.g. `subscribe` to "data ready" vs `subscribe` to "send
//! complete"). The mapping between _driver major numbers_ and drivers is
//! determined by a particular platform, while the _driver minor number_ is
//! driver-specific.
//!
//! One convention in Tock is that _driver minor number_ 0 for the `command`
//! syscall can always be used to determine if the driver is supported by
//! the running kernel by checking the return code. If the return value is
//! greater than or equal to zero then the driver is present. Typically this is
//! implemented by a null command that only returns 0, but in some cases the
//! command can also return more information, like the number of supported
//! devices (useful for things like the number of LEDs).
//!
//! # The `yield` System-call
//!
//! While drivers do not handle the `yield` system call, it is important to
//! understand its function and how it interacts with `subscribe`.

    /// Calls to subscribe should do minimal synchronous work.  Instead, they

    /// passing the result to the application via the callback.

    /// Drivers should allow each application to register a single callback for

    /// the same application would replace a previous callback.

    /// This pushes most per-application virtualization to the application
    /// itself. For example, a timer driver exposes only one timer to each
    /// application, and the application is responsible for virtualizing that
    /// timer if it needs to.
