//! Mechanism for inspecting the status of the kernel.
//!
//! In particular this provides functions for getting the status of processes
//! on the board. It potentially could be expanded to other kernel state.
//!
//! To restrict access on what can use this module, even though it is public (in
//! a Rust sense) so it is visible outside of this crate, the introspection
//! functions require the caller have the correct capability to call the
//! functions. This prevents arbitrary capsules from being able to use this
//! module, and only capsules that the board author has explicitly passed the
//! correct capabilities to can use it.
