/// Handle the `memop` syscall.
///
/// ### `memop_num`
///
/// - `0`: BRK. Change the location of the program break and return a
///   ReturnCode.
/// - `1`: SBRK. Change the location of the program break and return the
///   previous break address.
/// - `2`: Get the address of the start of the application's RAM allocation.
/// - `3`: Get the address pointing to the first address after the end of the
///   application's RAM allocation.
/// - `4`: Get the address of the start of the application's flash region. This
///   is where the TBF header is located.
/// - `5`: Get the address pointing to the first address after the end of the
///   application's flash region.
/// - `6`: Get the address of the lowest address of the grant region for the
///   app.
/// - `7`: Get the number of writeable flash regions defined in the header of
///   this app.
/// - `8`: Get the start address of the writeable region indexed from 0 by r1.
///   Returns (void*) -1 on failure, meaning the selected writeable region
///   does not exist.
/// - `9`: Get the end address of the writeable region indexed by r1. Returns
///   (void*) -1 on failure, meaning the selected writeable region does not
///   exist.
/// - `10`: Specify where the start of the app stack is. This tells the kernel
///   where the app has put the start of its stack. This is not strictly
///   necessary for correct operation, but allows for better debugging if the
///   app crashes.
/// - `11`: Specify where the start of the app heap is. This tells the kernel
///   where the app has put the start of its heap. This is not strictly
///   necessary for correct operation, but allows for better debugging if the
///   app crashes.
