//! Provides userspace access to a CRC unit.
//!
//! ## Instantiation
//!
//! Instantiate the capsule for use as a system call driver with a hardware
//! implementation and a `Grant` for the `App` type, and set the result as a
//! client of the hardware implementation. For example, using the SAM4L's `CRCU`
//! driver:
//!
//! ```rust
//! let crc = static_init!(
//!     capsules::crc::Crc<'static, sam4l::crccu::Crccu<'static>>,
//!     capsules::crc::Crc::new(&mut sam4l::crccu::CRCCU, kernel::Grant::create()));
//! sam4l::crccu::CRCCU.set_client(crc);
//!
//! ```
//!
//! ## CRC Algorithms
//!
//! The capsule supports two general purpose CRC algorithms, as well as a few
//! hardware specific algorithms implemented on the Atmel SAM4L.
//!
//! In the values used to identify polynomials below, more-significant bits
//! correspond to higher-order terms, and the most significant bit is omitted
//! because it always equals one.  All algorithms listed here consume each input
//! byte from most-significant bit to least-significant.
//!
//! ### CRC-32
//!
//! __Polynomial__: `0x04C11DB7`
//!
//! This algorithm is used in Ethernet and many other applications. It bit-
//! reverses and then bit-inverts the output.
//!
//! ### CRC-32C
//!
//! __Polynomial__: `0x1EDC6F41`
//!
//! Bit-reverses and then bit-inverts the output. It *may* be equivalent to
//! various CRC functions using the same name.
//!
//! ### SAM4L-16
//!
//! __Polynomial__: `0x1021`
//!
//! This algorithm does no post-processing on the output value. The sixteen-bit
//! CRC result is placed in the low-order bits of the returned result value, and
//! the high-order bits will all be set.  That is, result values will always be
//! of the form `0xFFFFxxxx` for this algorithm.  It can be performed purely in
//! hardware on the SAM4L.
//!
//! ### SAM4L-32
//!
//! __Polynomial__: `0x04C11DB7`
//!
//! This algorithm uses the same polynomial as `CRC-32`, but does no post-
//! processing on the output value.  It can be perfomed purely in hardware on
//! the SAM4L.
//!
//! ### SAM4L-32C
//!
//! __Polynomial__: `0x1EDC6F41`
//!
//! This algorithm uses the same polynomial as `CRC-32C`, but does no post-
//! processing on the output value.  It can be performed purely in hardware on
//! the SAM4L.
