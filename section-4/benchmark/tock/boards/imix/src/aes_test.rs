//! Test that AES (either CTR or CBC mode) is working properly.
//!
//! To test CBC mode, add the following line to the imix boot sequence:
//! ```
//!     aes_test::run_aes128_cbc();
//! ```
//! You should see the following output:
//! ```
//!     aes_test passed (CBC Enc Src/Dst)
//!     aes_test passed (CBC Dec Src/Dst)
//!     aes_test passed (CBC Enc In-place)
//!     aes_test passed (CBC Dec In-place)
//! ```
//! To test CTR mode, add the following line to the imix boot sequence:
//! ```
//!     aes_test::run_aes128_ctr();
//! ```
//! You should see the following output:
//! ```
//!     aes_test CTR passed: (CTR Enc Ctr Src/Dst)
//!     aes_test CTR passed: (CTR Dec Ctr Src/Dst)
//! ```
