//! This mod contains components to support rapid data import with the project
//! `tidb-lightning`.
//!
//! It mainly exposes 2 types of services:
//!
//! The `ImportKVService` is used to convert key-value pairs data to TiKV
//! compatible RocksDB SST file format for subsequent ingesting. The conversion
//! is done by writing data to a temporary created RocksDB instance. The service
//! is usually run independently of TiKV.
//!
//! The `ImportSSTService` is used to ingest the generated SST files into TiKV's
//! RocksDB instance. The ingesting process: `tidb-lightning` first uploads SST
//! files to the host where TiKV is located, and then calls the `Ingest` RPC.
//! After `ImportSSTService` receives the RPC, it sends a message to raftstore
//! thread to notify it of the ingesting operation.  This service is running
//! inside TiKV because it needs to interact with raftstore.
