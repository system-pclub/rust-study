## Report bugs!

Otherwise, just create a [new issue](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/issues/new) in our repository and state:

- What's your Parity Ethereum version?
- What's your operating system and version?
- How did you install Parity Ethereum?
- Is your node fully synchronized?
- Did you try turning it off and on again?

Also, try to include **steps to reproduce** the issue and expand on the **actual versus expected behavior**.
