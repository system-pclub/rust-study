## Parity [v1.9.0](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/releases/tag/v1.9.0) "Velocity" (2018-01-25)

We are happy to announce our newest Parity 1.9 release. Among others, it enables the following features:

- It integrates the fully reworked Parity Wallet and DApps browser (a.k.a. "UI 2.0", [#6819](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/6819)).
- It enables devp2p snappy compression ([#6683](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/6683)).
- AuRa Proof-of-Authority chains now disable uncles by default ([#7006](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/7006)). Existing PoA chains can go through a "maximum uncle count transition" to achieve more stability ([#7196](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/7196)).
- Added Expanse's Byzantium hard-fork ([#7463](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/7463)).
- Added support for Ellaism chain ([#7222](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/7222)).

Further, users upgrading from 1.8 should acknowledge the following changes:

- Fixed DELEGATECALL's from/to field ([#7568](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/7568)).
- Set zero nonce and gas price for calls by default ([#6954](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/6954)).
- Create pending blocks with all transactions from the queue ([#6942](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/6942)).
- Remove RPC parameter leniency now that Mist formats correctly ([#6651](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/6651)). Parity stops accepting decimal-formatted block numbers and stops parsing the empty string as empty bytes.
- Public nodes do not support the user interface anymore. If you are running a public node, please stay on the 1.8 branch of the stable releases.

Additional noteworthy changes:

- `ethstore` and `ethkey` have been significantly improved ([#6961](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/pull/6961)):
  - `ethstore` now supports brute forcing pre-sale wallets given a password list for recovery.
  - `ethkey` now supports multi-threaded generation of prefix-matching addresses.
  - `ethkey` now supports prefix-matching brain wallets.
  - `ethkey` now supports brain-wallets recovery-phrases lookup. This helps to find a correct phrase if you know the address you want to get yet you made a typo backing the phrase up, or forgot a word.
