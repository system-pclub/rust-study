Note: Parity 1.1 reached End-of-Life on 2016-08-12 (EOL).

## Parity [v1.1.0](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/releases/tag/v1.1.0) (2016-05-02)

Parity 1.1.0 introduces:

- Transaction tracing. Parity now optionally indexes & stores message-call/"internal transaction" information and provides additional RPC for querying.
- Web interface for logs, status & JSON RPC.
- Improved JSON RPC compatibility.
- Reduced memory footprint.
- Optimized EVM interpreter performance.
