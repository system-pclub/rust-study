//! Types used in the public API
//!
//! This crate stores Parity Etherem specific types that are
//! COMMONLY used across different separate modules of the codebase.
//! It should only focus on data structures, not any logic that relates to them.
//!
//! The interaction between modules should be possible by
//! implementing a required trait that potentially uses some of the data
//! structures from that crate.
//!
//! NOTE If you can specify your data type in the same crate as your trait, please do that.
//! Don't treat this crate as a bag for any types that we use in Parity Ethereum.
//! This one is reserved for types that are shared heavily (like transactions),
//! historically this contains types extracted from `ethcore` crate, if possible
//! we should try to dissolve that crate in favour of more fine-grained crates,
//! by moving the types closer to where they are actually required.
