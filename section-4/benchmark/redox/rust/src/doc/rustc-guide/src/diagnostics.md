# Emitting Errors and other Diagnostics

A lot of effort has been put into making `rustc` have great error messages.
This chapter is about how to emit compile errors and lints from the compiler.

## `Span`

[`Span`][span] is the primary data structure in `rustc` used to represent a
location in the code being compiled. `Span`s are attached to most constructs in
HIR and MIR, allowing for more informative error reporting.

[span]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/source_map/struct.Span.html

A `Span` can be looked up in a [`SourceMap`][sourcemap] to get a "snippet"
useful for displaying errors with [`span_to_snippet`][sptosnip] and other
similar methods on the `SourceMap`.

[sourcemap]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/source_map/struct.SourceMap.html
[sptosnip]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/source_map/struct.SourceMap.html#method.span_to_snippet

## Error messages

The [`rustc_errors`][errors] crate defines most of the utilities used for
reporting errors.

[errors]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/index.html

[`Session`][session] and [`ParseSess`][parsesses] have
methods (or fields with methods) that allow reporting errors. These methods
usually have names like `span_err` or `struct_span_err` or `span_warn`, etc...
There are lots of them; they emit different types of "errors", such as
warnings, errors, fatal errors, suggestions, etc.

[parsesses]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/sess/struct.ParseSess.html
[session]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/session/struct.Session.html

In general, there are two class of such methods: ones that emit an error
directly and ones that allow finer control over what to emit. For example,
[`span_err`][spanerr] emits the given error message at the given `Span`, but
[`struct_span_err`][strspanerr] instead returns a
[`DiagnosticBuilder`][diagbuild].

`DiagnosticBuilder` allows you to add related notes and suggestions to an error
before emitting it by calling the [`emit`][emit] method. (Failing to either
emit or [cancel][cancel] a `DiagnosticBuilder` will result in an ICE.) See the
[docs][diagbuild] for more info on what you can do.

[spanerr]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/session/struct.Session.html#method.span_err
[strspanerr]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/session/struct.Session.html#method.struct_span_err
[diagbuild]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/diagnostic_builder/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html
[emit]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/diagnostic_builder/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html#method.emit
[cancel]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/struct.Diagnostic.html#method.cancel

```rust,ignore
// Get a DiagnosticBuilder. This does _not_ emit an error yet.
let mut err = sess.struct_span_err(sp, "oh no! this is an error!");

// In some cases, you might need to check if `sp` is generated by a macro to
// avoid printing weird errors about macro-generated code.

if let Ok(snippet) = sess.source_map().span_to_snippet(sp) {
    // Use the snippet to generate a suggested fix
    err.span_suggestion(suggestion_sp, "try using a qux here", format!("qux {}", snip));
} else {
    // If we weren't able to generate a snippet, then emit a "help" message
    // instead of a concrete "suggestion". In practice this is unlikely to be
    // reached.
    err.span_help(suggestion_sp, "you could use a qux here instead");
}

// emit the error
err.emit();
```

## Suggestions

In addition to telling the user exactly _why_ their code is wrong, it's
oftentimes furthermore possible to tell them how to fix it. To this end,
`DiagnosticBuilder` offers a structured suggestions API, which formats code
suggestions pleasingly in the terminal, or (when the `--error-format json` flag
is passed) as JSON for consumption by tools, most notably the [Rust Language
Server][rls] and [`rustfix`][rustfix].

[rls]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rls
[rustfix]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfix

Not all suggestions should be applied mechanically. Use the
[`span_suggestion`][span_suggestion] method of `DiagnosticBuilder` to
make a suggestion. The last argument provides a hint to tools whether
the suggestion is mechanically applicable or not.

[span_suggestion]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html#method.span_suggestion

For example, to make our `qux` suggestion machine-applicable, we would do:

```rust,ignore
let mut err = sess.struct_span_err(sp, "oh no! this is an error!");

if let Ok(snippet) = sess.source_map().span_to_snippet(sp) {
    err.span_suggestion(
        suggestion_sp,
        "try using a qux here",
        format!("qux {}", snip),
        Applicability::MachineApplicable,
    );
} else {
    err.span_help(suggestion_sp, "you could use a qux here instead");
}

err.emit();
```

This might emit an error like

```console
$ rustc mycode.rs
error[E0999]: oh no! this is an error!
 --> mycode.rs:3:5
  |
3 |     sad()
  |     ^ help: try using a qux here: `qux sad()`

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0999`.
```

In some cases, like when the suggestion spans multiple lines or when there are
multiple suggestions, the suggestions are displayed on their own:

```console
error[E0999]: oh no! this is an error!
 --> mycode.rs:3:5
  |
3 |     sad()
  |     ^
help: try using a qux here:
  |
3 |     qux sad()
  |     ^^^

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0999`.
```

The possible values of [`Applicability`][appl] are:

- `MachineApplicable`: Can be applied mechanically.
- `HasPlaceholders`: Cannot be applied mechanically because it has placeholder
  text in the suggestions. For example, "Try adding a type: \`let x:
  \<type\>\`".
- `MaybeIncorrect`: Cannot be applied mechanically because the suggestion may
  or may not be a good one.
- `Unspecified`: Cannot be applied mechanically because we don't know which
  of the above cases it falls into.

## Lints

The compiler linting infrastructure is defined in the [`rustc::lint`][rlint]
module.

[rlint]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/lint/index.html

### Declaring a lint

The built-in compiler lints are defined in the [`rustc_lint`][builtin]
crate.

[builtin]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/index.html

Every lint is implemented via a `struct` that implements the `LintPass` `trait`
(you also implement one of the more specific lint pass traits, either
`EarlyLintPass` or `LateLintPass`).  The trait implementation allows you to
check certain syntactic constructs as the linter walks the source code. You can
then choose to emit lints in a very similar way to compile errors.

You also declare the metadata of a particular lint via the `declare_lint!`
macro. This includes the name, the default level, a short description, and some
more details.

Note that the lint and the lint pass must be registered with the compiler.

For example, the following lint checks for uses
of `while true { ... }` and suggests using `loop { ... }` instead.

```rust,ignore
// Declare a lint called `WHILE_TRUE`
declare_lint! {
    WHILE_TRUE,

    // warn-by-default
    Warn,

    // This string is the lint description
    "suggest using `loop { }` instead of `while true { }`"
}

// Define a struct and `impl LintPass` for it.
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct WhileTrue;

// This declares a lint pass, providing a list of associated lints.  The
// compiler currently doesn't use the associated lints directly (e.g., to not
// run the pass or otherwise check that the pass emits the appropriate set of
// lints). However, it's good to be accurate here as it's possible that we're
// going to register the lints via the get_lints method on our lint pass (that
// this macro generates).
impl_lint_pass!(
    WhileTrue => [WHILE_TRUE],
);

// LateLintPass has lots of methods. We only override the definition of
// `check_expr` for this lint because that's all we need, but you could
// override other methods for your own lint. See the rustc docs for a full
// list of methods.
impl<'a, 'tcx> LateLintPass<'a, 'tcx> for WhileTrue {
    fn check_expr(&mut self, cx: &LateContext, e: &hir::Expr) {
        if let hir::ExprWhile(ref cond, ..) = e.node {
            if let hir::ExprLit(ref lit) = cond.node {
                if let ast::LitKind::Bool(true) = lit.node {
                    if lit.span.ctxt() == SyntaxContext::empty() {
                        let msg = "denote infinite loops with `loop { ... }`";
                        let condition_span = cx.tcx.sess.source_map().def_span(e.span);
                        let mut err = cx.struct_span_lint(WHILE_TRUE, condition_span, msg);
                        err.span_suggestion_short(condition_span, "use `loop`", "loop".to_owned());
                        err.emit();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Edition-gated Lints

Sometimes we want to change the behavior of a lint in a new edition. To do this,
we just add the transition to our invocation of `declare_lint!`:

```rust,ignore
declare_lint! {
    pub ANONYMOUS_PARAMETERS,
    Allow,
    "detects anonymous parameters",
    Edition::Edition2018 => Warn,
}
```

This makes the `ANONYMOUS_PARAMETERS` lint allow-by-default in the 2015 edition
but warn-by-default in the 2018 edition.

A future-incompatible lint should be declared with the `@future_incompatible`
additional "field":

```rust,ignore
declare_lint! {
    pub ANONYMOUS_PARAMETERS,
    Allow,
    "detects anonymous parameters",
    @future_incompatible = FutureIncompatibleInfo {
        reference: "issue #41686 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41686>",
        edition: Some(Edition::Edition2018),
    };
}
```

If you need a combination of options that's not supported by the
`declare_lint!` macro, you can always define your own static with a type of
`&Lint` but this is currently linted against in the compiler tree.

####  Guidelines for creating a future incompatibility lint

- Create a lint defaulting to warn as normal, with ideally the same error
  message you would normally give.
- Add a suitable reference, typically an RFC or tracking issue. Go ahead
  and include the full URL, sort items in ascending order of issue numbers.
- Later, change lint to error.
- Eventually, remove lint.

### Lint Groups

Lints can be turned on in groups. These groups are declared in the
[`register_builtins`][rbuiltins] function in [`rustc_lint::lib`][builtin]. The
`add_lint_group!` macro is used to declare a new group.

[rbuiltins]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/fn.register_builtins.html

For example,

```rust,ignore
    add_lint_group!(sess,
                    "nonstandard_style",
                    NON_CAMEL_CASE_TYPES,
                    NON_SNAKE_CASE,
                    NON_UPPER_CASE_GLOBALS);
```

This defines the `nonstandard_style` group which turns on the listed lints. A
user can turn on these lints with a `!#[warn(nonstandard_style)]` attribute in
the source code, or by passing `-W nonstandard-style` on the command line.

### Linting early in the compiler

On occasion, you may need to define a lint that runs before the linting system
has been initialized (e.g. during parsing or macro expansion). This is
problematic because we need to have computed lint levels to know whether we
should emit a warning or an error or nothing at all.

To solve this problem, we buffer the lints until the linting system is
processed. [`Session`][sessbl] and [`ParseSess`][parsebl] both have
`buffer_lint` methods that allow you to buffer a lint for later. The linting
system automatically takes care of handling buffered lints later.

[sessbl]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/session/struct.Session.html#method.buffer_lint
[parsebl]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/sess/struct.ParseSess.html#method.buffer_lint

Thus, to define a lint that runs early in the compilation, one defines a lint
like normal but invokes the lint with `buffer_lint`.

#### Linting even earlier in the compiler

The parser (`libsyntax`) is interesting in that it cannot have dependencies on
any of the other `librustc*` crates. In particular, it cannot depend on
`librustc::lint` or `librustc_lint`, where all of the compiler linting
infrastructure is defined. That's troublesome!

To solve this, `libsyntax` defines its own buffered lint type, which
`ParseSess::buffer_lint` uses. After macro expansion, these buffered lints are
then dumped into the `Session::buffered_lints` used by the rest of the compiler.

Usage for buffered lints in `libsyntax` is pretty much the same as the rest of
the compiler with one exception because we cannot import the `LintId`s for
lints we want to emit. Instead, the [`BufferedEarlyLintId`] type is used. If you
are defining a new lint, you will want to add an entry to this enum. Then, add
an appropriate mapping to the body of [`Lint::from_parser_lint_id`][fplid].

[`BufferedEarlyLintId`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/early_buffered_lints/enum.BufferedEarlyLintId.html
[fplid]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/lint/struct.Lint.html#method.from_parser_lint_id

## JSON diagnostic output

The compiler accepts an `--error-format json` flag to output
diagnostics as JSON objects (for the benefit of tools such as `cargo
fix` or the RLS). It looks like this—

```console
$ rustc json_error_demo.rs --error-format json
{"message":"cannot add `&str` to `{integer}`","code":{"code":"E0277","explanation":"\nYou tried to use a type which doesn't implement some trait in a place which\nexpected that trait. Erroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\n// here we declare the Foo trait with a bar method\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we now declare a function which takes an object implementing the Foo trait\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // we now call the method with the i32 type, which doesn't implement\n    // the Foo trait\n    some_func(5i32); // error: the trait bound `i32 : Foo` is not satisfied\n}\n```\n\nIn order to fix this error, verify that the type you're using does implement\nthe trait. Example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar(); // we can now use this method since i32 implements the\n               // Foo trait\n}\n\n// we implement the trait on the i32 type\nimpl Foo for i32 {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    some_func(5i32); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr in a generic context, an erroneous code example would look like:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\nfn some_func<T>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo); // error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not\n                           //        implemented for the type `T`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // We now call the method with the i32 type,\n    // which *does* implement the Debug trait.\n    some_func(5i32);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the error here is in the definition of the generic function: Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function: It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func<T: fmt::Debug>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"json_error_demo.rs","byte_start":50,"byte_end":51,"line_start":4,"line_end":4,"column_start":7,"column_end":8,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    a + b","highlight_start":7,"highlight_end":8}],"label":"no implementation for `{integer} + &str`","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"the trait `std::ops::Add<&str>` is not implemented for `{integer}`","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"error[E0277]: cannot add `&str` to `{integer}`\n --> json_error_demo.rs:4:7\n  |\n4 |     a + b\n  |       ^ no implementation for `{integer} + &str`\n  |\n  = help: the trait `std::ops::Add<&str>` is not implemented for `{integer}`\n\n"}
{"message":"aborting due to previous error","code":null,"level":"error","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":"error: aborting due to previous error\n\n"}
{"message":"For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.","code":null,"level":"","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":"For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.\n"}
```

Note that the output is a series of lines, each of which is a JSON
object, but the series of lines taken together is, unfortunately, not
valid JSON, thwarting tools and tricks (such as [piping to `python3 -m
json.tool`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json.tool))
that require such. (One speculates that this was intentional for LSP
performance purposes, so that each line/object can be sent to RLS as
it is flushed?)

Also note the "rendered" field, which contains the "human" output as a
string; this was introduced so that UI tests could both make use of
the structured JSON and see the "human" output (well, _sans_ colors)
without having to compile everything twice.

The JSON emitter currently lives in libsyntax/json.rs. (But arguably
it should live in librustc_errors along with the "human" emitter? It's
not obvious to the present author why it wasn't moved from libsyntax
to librustc_errors at the same [time the "human" emitter was
moved](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/6ae3502134).)

The JSON emitter defines [its own `Diagnostic`
struct](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b2c6b8c29f13f8d1f242da89e587960b95337819/src/libsyntax/json.rs#L85-L99)
(and sub-structs) for the JSON serialization. Don't confuse this with
[`errors::Diagnostic`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/struct.Diagnostic.html)!

## `#[rustc_on_unimplemented(...)]`

The `#[rustc_on_unimplemented]` attribute allows trait definitions to add specialized
notes to error messages when an implementation was expected but not found.
You can refer to the trait's generic arguments by name and to the resolved type using `Self`.

For example:

```rust,ignore
#![feature(rustc_attrs)]

#[rustc_on_unimplemented="an iterator over elements of type `{A}` \
    cannot be built from a collection of type `{Self}`"]
trait MyIterator<A> {
    fn next(&mut self) -> A;
}

fn iterate_chars<I: MyIterator<char>>(i: I) {
    // ...
}

fn main() {
    iterate_chars(&[1, 2, 3][..]);
}
```

When the user compiles this, they will see the following;

```txt
error[E0277]: the trait bound `&[{integer}]: MyIterator<char>` is not satisfied
  --> <anon>:14:5
   |
14 |     iterate_chars(&[1, 2, 3][..]);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ an iterator over elements of type `char` cannot be built from a collection of type `&[{integer}]`
   |
   = help: the trait `MyIterator<char>` is not implemented for `&[{integer}]`
   = note: required by `iterate_chars`
```

`rustc_on_unimplemented` also supports advanced filtering for better targeting
of messages, as well as modifying specific parts of the error message. You
target the text of:

 - the main error message (`message`)
 - the label (`label`)
 - an extra note (`note`)

For example, the following attribute

```rust,ignore
#[rustc_on_unimplemented(
    message="message",
    label="label",
    note="note"
)]
trait MyIterator<A> {
    fn next(&mut self) -> A;
}
```

Would generate the following output:

```text
error[E0277]: message
  --> <anon>:14:5
   |
14 |     iterate_chars(&[1, 2, 3][..]);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ label
   |
   = note: note
   = help: the trait `MyIterator<char>` is not implemented for `&[{integer}]`
   = note: required by `iterate_chars`
```

To allow more targeted error messages, it is possible to filter the
application of these fields based on a variety of attributes when using
`on`:

 - `crate_local`: whether the code causing the trait bound to not be
   fulfilled is part of the user's crate. This is used to avoid suggesting
   code changes that would require modifying a dependency.
 - Any of the generic arguments that can be substituted in the text can be
   referred by name as well for filtering, like `Rhs="i32"`, except for
   `Self`.
 - `_Self`: to filter only on a particular calculated trait resolution, like
   `Self="std::iter::Iterator<char>"`. This is needed because `Self` is a
   keyword which cannot appear in attributes.
 - `direct`: user-specified rather than derived obligation.
 - `from_method`: usable both as boolean (whether the flag is present, like
   `crate_local`) or matching against a particular method. Currently used
   for `try`.
 - `from_desugaring`: usable both as boolean (whether the flag is present)
   or matching against a particular desugaring. The desugaring is identified
   with its variant name in the `DesugaringKind` enum.

For example, the `Iterator` trait can be annotated in the following way:

```rust,ignore
#[rustc_on_unimplemented(
    on(
        _Self="&str",
        note="call `.chars()` or `.as_bytes()` on `{Self}"
    ),
    message="`{Self}` is not an iterator",
    label="`{Self}` is not an iterator",
    note="maybe try calling `.iter()` or a similar method"
)]
pub trait Iterator {}
```

Which would produce the following outputs:

```text
error[E0277]: `Foo` is not an iterator
 --> src/main.rs:4:16
  |
4 |     for foo in Foo {}
  |                ^^^ `Foo` is not an iterator
  |
  = note: maybe try calling `.iter()` or a similar method
  = help: the trait `std::iter::Iterator` is not implemented for `Foo`
  = note: required by `std::iter::IntoIterator::into_iter`

error[E0277]: `&str` is not an iterator
 --> src/main.rs:5:16
  |
5 |     for foo in "" {}
  |                ^^ `&str` is not an iterator
  |
  = note: call `.chars()` or `.bytes() on `&str`
  = help: the trait `std::iter::Iterator` is not implemented for `&str`
  = note: required by `std::iter::IntoIterator::into_iter`
```

If you need to filter on multiple attributes, you can use `all`, `any` or
`not` in the following way:

```rust,ignore
#[rustc_on_unimplemented(
    on(
        all(_Self="&str", T="std::string::String"),
        note="you can coerce a `{T}` into a `{Self}` by writing `&*variable`"
    )
)]
pub trait From<T>: Sized { /* ... */ }
```
