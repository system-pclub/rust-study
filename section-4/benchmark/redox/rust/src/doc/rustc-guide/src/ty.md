# The `ty` module: representing types

The `ty` module defines how the Rust compiler represents types
internally. It also defines the *typing context* (`tcx` or `TyCtxt`),
which is the central data structure in the compiler.

## The tcx and how it uses lifetimes

The `tcx` ("typing context") is the central data structure in the
compiler. It is the context that you use to perform all manner of
queries. The struct `TyCtxt` defines a reference to this shared context:

```rust,ignore
tcx: TyCtxt<'tcx>
//          ----
//          |
//          arena lifetime
```

As you can see, the `TyCtxt` type takes a lifetime parameter.
During Rust compilation, we allocate most of our memory in
**arenas**, which are basically pools of memory that get freed all at
once. When you see a reference with a lifetime like `'tcx`,
you know that it refers to arena-allocated data (or data that lives as
long as the arenas, anyhow).

### Allocating and working with types

Rust types are represented using the `Ty<'tcx>` defined in the `ty`
module (not to be confused with the `Ty` struct from [the HIR]). This
is in fact a simple type alias for a reference with `'tcx` lifetime:

```rust,ignore
pub type Ty<'tcx> = &'tcx TyS<'tcx>;
```

[the HIR]: ./hir.html

You can basically ignore the `TyS` struct – you will basically never
access it explicitly. We always pass it by reference using the
`Ty<'tcx>` alias – the only exception I think is to define inherent
methods on types. Instances of `TyS` are only ever allocated in one of
the rustc arenas (never e.g. on the stack).

One common operation on types is to **match** and see what kinds of
types they are. This is done by doing `match ty.sty`, sort of like this:

```rust,ignore
fn test_type<'tcx>(ty: Ty<'tcx>) {
    match ty.sty {
        ty::TyArray(elem_ty, len) => { ... }
        ...
    }
}
```

The `sty` field (the origin of this name is unclear to me; perhaps
structural type?) is of type `TyKind<'tcx>`, which is an enum
defining all of the different kinds of types in the compiler.

> risky, as there may be inference variables and other things to

To allocate a new type, you can use the various `mk_` methods defined
on the `tcx`. These have names that correspond mostly to the various kinds
of type variants. For example:

```rust,ignore
let array_ty = tcx.mk_array(elem_ty, len * 2);
```

These methods all return a `Ty<'tcx>` – note that the lifetime you
get back is the lifetime of the innermost arena that this `tcx` has
access to. In fact, types are always canonicalized and interned (so we
never allocate exactly the same type twice) and are always allocated
in the outermost arena where they can be (so, if they do not contain
any inference variables or other "temporary" types, they will be
allocated in the global arena). However, the lifetime `'tcx` is always
a safe approximation, so that is what you get back.

You can also find various common types in the `tcx` itself by accessing
`tcx.types.bool`, `tcx.types.char`, etc (see `CommonTypes` for more).

### Beyond types: other kinds of arena-allocated data structures

In addition to types, there are a number of other arena-allocated data
structures that you can allocate, and which are found in this
module. Here are a few examples:

- [`Substs`][subst], allocated with `mk_substs` – this will intern a slice of
  types, often used to specify the values to be substituted for generics
  (e.g. `HashMap<i32, u32>` would be represented as a slice
  `&'tcx [tcx.types.i32, tcx.types.u32]`).
- `TraitRef`, typically passed by value – a **trait reference**
  consists of a reference to a trait along with its various type
  parameters (including `Self`), like `i32: Display` (here, the def-id
  would reference the `Display` trait, and the substs would contain
  `i32`).
- `Predicate` defines something the trait system has to prove (see `traits`
  module).

### Import conventions

Although there is no hard and fast rule, the `ty` module tends to be used like
so:

```rust,ignore
use ty::{self, Ty, TyCtxt};
```

In particular, since they are so common, the `Ty` and `TyCtxt` types
are imported directly. Other types are often referenced with an
explicit `ty::` prefix (e.g. `ty::TraitRef<'tcx>`). But some modules
choose to import a larger or smaller set of names explicitly.
