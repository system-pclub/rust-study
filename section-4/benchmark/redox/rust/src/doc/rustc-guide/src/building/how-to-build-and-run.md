# How to Build and Run the Compiler

The compiler is built using a tool called `x.py`. You will need to
have Python installed to run it. But before we get to that, if you're going to
be hacking on `rustc`, you'll want to tweak the configuration of the compiler.
The default configuration is oriented towards running the compiler as a user,
not a developer.

## Create a config.toml

To start, copy [`config.toml.example`] to `config.toml`:

[`config.toml.example`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/config.toml.example

```bash
> cd $RUST_CHECKOUT
> cp config.toml.example config.toml
```

Then you will want to open up the file and change the following
settings (and possibly others, such as `llvm.ccache`):

```toml
[llvm]
# Enables LLVM assertions, which will check that the LLVM bitcode generated
# by the compiler is internally consistent. These are particularly helpful
# if you edit `codegen`.
assertions = true

[rust]
# This will make your build more parallel; it costs a bit of runtime
# performance perhaps (less inlining) but it's worth it.
codegen-units = 0

# This enables full debuginfo and debug assertions. The line debuginfo is also
# enabled by `debuginfo-level = 1`. Full debuginfo is also enabled by
# `debuginfo-level = 2`. Debug assertions can also be enabled with
# `debug-assertions = true`. Note that `debug = true` will make your build
# slower, so you may want to try individually enabling debuginfo and assertions
# or enable only line debuginfo which is basically free.
debug = true
```

If you have already built `rustc`, then you may have to execute `rm -rf build` for subsequent
configuration changes to take effect. Note that `./x.py clean` will not cause a
rebuild of LLVM, so if your configuration change affects LLVM, you will need to
manually `rm -rf build/` before rebuilding.

## What is `x.py`?

`x.py` is the script used to orchestrate the tooling in the `rustc` repository.
It is the script that can build docs, run tests, and compile `rustc`.
It is the now preferred way to build `rustc` and it replaces the old makefiles
from before. Below are the different ways to utilize `x.py` in order to
effectively deal with the repo for various common tasks.

This chapter focuses on the basics to be productive, but
if you want to learn more about `x.py`, read its README.md
[here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/bootstrap/README.md).

## Bootstrapping

One thing to keep in mind is that `rustc` is a _bootstrapping_
compiler. That is, since `rustc` is written in Rust, we need to use an
older version of the compiler to compile the newer version. In
particular, the newer version of the compiler and some of the artifacts needed
to build it, such as `libstd` and other tooling, may use some unstable features
internally, requiring a specific version which understands these unstable
features.

The result is that compiling `rustc` is done in stages:

- **Stage 0:** the stage0 compiler is usually (you can configure `x.py` to use
  something else) the current _beta_ `rustc` compiler and its associated dynamic
  libraries (which `x.py` will download for you). This stage0 compiler is then
  used only to compile `rustbuild`, `std`, and `rustc`. When compiling
  `rustc`, this stage0 compiler uses the freshly compiled `std`.
  There are two concepts at play here: a compiler (with its set of dependencies)
  and its 'target' or 'object' libraries (`std` and `rustc`).
  Both are staged, but in a staggered manner.
- **Stage 1:** the code in your clone (for new version) is then
  compiled with the stage0 compiler to produce the stage1 compiler.
  However, it was built with an older compiler (stage0), so to
  optimize the stage1 compiler we go to next the stage.
  - In theory, the stage1 compiler is functionally identical to the
    stage2 compiler, but in practice there are subtle differences. In
    particular, the stage1 compiler itself was built by stage0 and
    hence not by the source in your working directory: this means that
    the symbol names used in the compiler source may not match the
    symbol names that would have been made by the stage1 compiler.
    This can be important when using dynamic linking (e.g., with
    derives. Sometimes this means that some tests don't work when run
    with stage1.
- **Stage 2:** we rebuild our stage1 compiler with itself to produce
  the stage2 compiler (i.e. it builds itself) to have all the _latest
  optimizations_. (By default, we copy the stage1 libraries for use by
  the stage2 compiler, since they ought to be identical.)
- _(Optional)_ **Stage 3**: to sanity check our new compiler, we
  can build the libraries with the stage2 compiler. The result ought
  to be identical to before, unless something has broken.

## Building the Compiler

To build a compiler, run `./x.py build`. This will do the whole bootstrapping
process described above, producing a usable compiler toolchain from the source
code you have checked out. This takes a long time, so it is not usually what
you want to actually run (more on this later).

There are many flags you can pass to the build command of `x.py` that can be
beneficial to cutting down compile times or fitting other things you might
need to change. They are:

```txt
Options:
    -v, --verbose       use verbose output (-vv for very verbose)
    -i, --incremental   use incremental compilation
        --config FILE   TOML configuration file for build
        --build BUILD   build target of the stage0 compiler
        --host HOST     host targets to build
        --target TARGET target targets to build
        --on-fail CMD   command to run on failure
        --stage N       stage to build
        --keep-stage N  stage to keep without recompiling
        --src DIR       path to the root of the rust checkout
    -j, --jobs JOBS     number of jobs to run in parallel
    -h, --help          print this help message
```

For hacking, often building the stage 1 compiler is enough, but for
final testing and release, the stage 2 compiler is used.

`./x.py check` is really fast to build the rust compiler.
It is, in particular, very useful when you're doing some kind of
"type-based refactoring", like renaming a method, or changing the
signature of some function.

<a name=command></a>

Once you've created a config.toml, you are now ready to run
`x.py`. There are a lot of options here, but let's start with what is
probably the best "go to" command for building a local rust:

```bash
> ./x.py build -i --stage 1 src/libstd
```

This may *look* like it only builds libstd, but that is not the case.
What this command does is the following:

- Build `libstd` using the stage0 compiler (using incremental)
- Build `librustc` using the stage0 compiler (using incremental)
  - This produces the stage1 compiler
- Build libstd using the stage1 compiler (cannot use incremental)

This final product (stage1 compiler + libs built using that compiler)
is what you need to build other rust programs (unless you use `#![no_std]` or
`#![no_core]`).

The command includes the `-i` switch which enables incremental compilation.
This will be used to speed up the first two steps of the process:
in particular, if you make a small change, we ought to be able to use your old
results to make producing the stage1 **compiler** faster.

Unfortunately, incremental cannot be used to speed up making the
stage1 libraries.  This is because incremental only works when you run
the *same compiler* twice in a row.  In this case, we are building a
*new stage1 compiler* every time. Therefore, the old incremental
results may not apply. **As a result, you will probably find that
building the stage1 `libstd` is a bottleneck for you** -- but fear not,
there is a (hacky) workaround.  See [the section on "recommended
workflows"](./suggested.md) below.

Note that this whole command just gives you a subset of the full `rustc`
build. The **full** `rustc` build (what you get if you just say `./x.py
build`) has quite a few more steps:

- Build `librustc` and `rustc` with the stage1 compiler.
  - The resulting compiler here is called the "stage2" compiler.
- Build libstd with stage2 compiler.
- Build librustdoc and a bunch of other things with the stage2 compiler.

<a name=toolchain></a>

## Build specific components

Build only the libcore library

```bash
> ./x.py build src/libcore
```

Build the libcore and libproc_macro library only

```bash
> ./x.py build src/libcore src/libproc_macro
```

Build only libcore up to Stage 1

```bash
> ./x.py build src/libcore --stage 1
```

Sometimes you might just want to test if the part youâ€™re working on can
compile. Using these commands you can test that it compiles before doing
a bigger build to make sure it works with the compiler. As shown before
you can also pass flags at the end such as --stage.

## Creating a rustup toolchain

Once you have successfully built `rustc`, you will have created a bunch
of files in your `build` directory. In order to actually run the
resulting `rustc`, we recommend creating rustup toolchains. The first
one will run the stage1 compiler (which we built above). The second
will execute the stage2 compiler (which we did not build, but which
you will likely need to build at some point; for example, if you want
to run the entire test suite).

```bash
> rustup toolchain link stage1 build/<host-triple>/stage1
> rustup toolchain link stage2 build/<host-triple>/stage2
```

The `<host-triple>` would typically be one of the following:

- Linux: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- Mac: `x86_64-apple-darwin`
- Windows: `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

Now you can run the `rustc` you built with. If you run with `-vV`, you
should see a version number ending in `-dev`, indicating a build from
your local environment:

```bash
> rustc +stage1 -vV
rustc 1.25.0-dev
binary: rustc
commit-hash: unknown
commit-date: unknown
host: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
release: 1.25.0-dev
LLVM version: 4.0
```
## Other `x.py` commands

Here are a few other useful `x.py` commands. We'll cover some of them in detail
in other sections:

- Building things:
  - `./x.py clean` â€“ clean up the build directory (`rm -rf build` works too,
    but then you have to rebuild LLVM)
  - `./x.py build --stage 1` â€“ builds everything using the stage 1 compiler,
    not just up to libstd
  - `./x.py build` â€“ builds the stage2 compiler
- Running tests (see the [section on running tests](../tests/running.html) for
  more details):
  - `./x.py test --stage 1 src/libstd` â€“ runs the `#[test]` tests from libstd
  - `./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/ui` â€“ runs the `ui` test suite
  - `./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/ui/const-generics` - runs all the tests in
  the `const-generics/` subdirectory of the `ui` test suite
  - `./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/ui/const-generics/const-types.rs` - runs
  the single test `const-types.rs` from the `ui` test suite

### Cleaning out build directories

Sometimes you need to start fresh, but this is normally not the case.
If you need to run this then rustbuild is most likely not acting right and
you should file a bug as to what is going wrong. If you do need to clean
everything up then you only need to run one command!

   ```bash
   > ./x.py clean
   ```
