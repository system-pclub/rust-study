If you'd like to read more background material, here are some
recommended texts and papers:

[Programming with Higher-order Logic][phl], by Dale Miller and Gopalan
Nadathur, covers the key concepts of Lambda prolog. Although it's a
slim little volume, it's the kind of book where you learn something
new every time you open it.

["A proof procedure for the logic of Hereditary Harrop formulas"][pphhf],
by Gopalan Nadathur. This paper covers the basics of universes,
environments, and Lambda Prolog-style proof search. Quite readable.

["A new formulation of tabled resolution with delay"][nftrd], by
