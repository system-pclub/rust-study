The new-style trait solver is based on the work done in [chalk][chalk]. Chalk
recasts Rust's trait system explicitly in terms of logic programming. It does
this by "lowering" Rust code into a kind of logic program we can then execute
queries against.

You can read more about chalk itself in the
[Overview of Chalk](./chalk-overview.md) section.

Trait solving in rustc is based around a few key ideas:

- [Lowering to logic](./lowering-to-logic.html), which expresses
  Rust traits in terms of standard logical terms.
  - The [goals and clauses](./goals-and-clauses.html) chapter
    describes the precise form of rules we use, and
    [lowering rules](./lowering-rules.html) gives the complete set of
    lowering rules in a more reference-like form.
  - [Lazy normalization](./associated-types.html), which is the
    technique we use to accommodate associated types when figuring out
    whether types are equal.
  - [Region constraints](./regions.html), which are accumulated
    during trait solving but mostly ignored. This means that trait
    solving effectively ignores the precise regions involved, always â€“
    but we still remember the constraints on them so that those
    constraints can be checked by the type checker.
- [Canonical queries](./canonical-queries.html), which allow us
  to solve trait problems (like "is `Foo` implemented for the type
  `Bar`?") once, and then apply that same result independently in many
  different inference contexts.

## Ongoing work
The design of the new-style trait solving currently happens in two places:

**chalk**. The [chalk][chalk] repository is where we experiment with new ideas
and designs for the trait system. It primarily consists of two parts:
* a unit testing framework
  for the correctness and feasibility of the logical rules defining the
  new-style trait system.
* the [`chalk_engine`][chalk_engine] crate, which
  defines the new-style trait solver used both in the unit testing framework
  and in rustc.

**rustc**. Once we are happy with the logical rules, we proceed to
implementing them in rustc. This mainly happens in
[`librustc_traits`][librustc_traits].
