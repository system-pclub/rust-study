# Part 2: How rustc works

This part of the guide describes how the compiler works. It goes through
everything from high-level structure of the compiler to how each stage of
compilation works.

This section should be friendly to both readers interested in the end-to-end
process of compilation _and_ readers interested in learning about a specific
system they wish to contribute to. If anything is unclear, feel free to file
an issue on the [rustc-guide repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-guide)
or contact the compiler team, as detailed in [this chapter from Part
1](./compiler-team.md).
