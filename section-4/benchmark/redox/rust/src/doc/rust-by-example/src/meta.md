Some topics aren't exactly relevant to how you program but provide you
tooling or infrastructure support which just makes things better for
everyone. These topics include:

* Documentation: Generate library documentation for users via the included
`rustdoc`.
* Testing: Create testsuites for libraries to give confidence that your
library does exactly what it's supposed to.
* Benchmarking: Create benchmarks for functionality to be confident that
they run quickly.
