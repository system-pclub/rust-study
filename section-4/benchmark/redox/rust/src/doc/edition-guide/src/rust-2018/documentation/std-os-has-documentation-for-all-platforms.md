# `std::os` has documentation for all platforms

![Minimum Rust version: 1.21](https://img.shields.io/badge/Minimum%20Rust%20Version-1.21-brightgreen.svg)

The `std::os` module contains operating system specific functionality. You’ll
now see more than just linux, the platform we build the documentation on.

We’ve long regretted that the hosted version of the documentation has been
Linux-specific; this is a first step towards rectifying that. This is
specific to the standard library and not for general use; we hope to improve
this further in the future.
