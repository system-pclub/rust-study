# async/await for easier concurrency

![Minimum Rust version: nightly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Minimum%20Rust%20Version-nightly-red.svg)

The initial release of Rust 2018 won't ship with `async`/`await` support, but
we have reserved the keywords so that a future release will contain them.
We'll update this page when it's closer to shipping!
