# The Rustonomicon

![Minimum Rust version: 1.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Minimum%20Rust%20Version-1.3-brightgreen.svg)

We now have a draft book, [The Rustonomicon: the Dark Arts of Advanced and
Unsafe Rust Programming](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/).

From the title, I'm sure you can guess: this book discusses some advanced
topics, including `unsafe`. It's a must-read for anyone who's working at the
lowest levels with Rust.
