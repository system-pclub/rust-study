# Introduction

Welcome to the Rust Edition Guide! "Editions" are Rust's way of communicating
large changes in the way that it feels to write Rust code.

In this guide, we'll discuss:

* What editions are
* What each edition is about
* How to migrate your code from one edition to another

Note that the standard library grows with each Rust release; there are *many*
additions to the standard library that are not called out in this guide. Only
the major ones are, but there's tons of medium and small things that are
great too. You may want to check out [the standard library
documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) as well.
