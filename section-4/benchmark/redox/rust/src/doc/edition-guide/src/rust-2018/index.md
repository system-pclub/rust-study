# Rust 2018

The edition system was created for the release of Rust 2018. The theme of Rust 2018
is *productivity*. Rust 2018 improves upon Rust 2015 through new features,
simpler syntax in some cases, a smarter borrow-checker, and a host of other things.
These are all in service of the productivity goal. Rust 2015 was a foundation;
Rust 2018 smooths off rough edges, makes writing code simpler and easier,
and removes some inconsistencies.
