# 2018-Specific Changes

The following is a summary of changes that only apply to code compiled with
the 2018 edition compared to the 2015 edition.

- [Path changes]:
    - Paths in `use` declarations work the same as other paths.
    - Paths starting with `::` must be followed with an external crate.
    - Paths in `pub(in path)` visibility modifiers must start with `crate`,
      `self`, or `super`.
- [Anonymous trait function parameters] are not allowed.
    - [Trait function parameters] may use any irrefutable pattern when the
      function has a body.
- [`dyn`] is a [strict keyword], in 2015 it is a [weak keyword].
- `async`, `await`, and `try` are [reserved keywords].
- The following lints are now deny by default:
    - [tyvar_behind_raw_pointer]

## Cargo
- If there is a target definition in a `Cargo.toml` manifest, it no longer
  automatically disables automatic discovery of other targets.
- Target paths of the form `src/{target_name}.rs` are no longer inferred for
  targets where the `path` field is not set.
- `cargo install` for the current directory is no longer allowed, you must
  specify `cargo install --path .` to install the current package.
