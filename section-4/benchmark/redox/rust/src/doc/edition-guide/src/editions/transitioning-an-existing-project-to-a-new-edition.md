# Transitioning an existing project to a new edition

New editions might change the way you write Rust â€“ they add new syntax,
language, and library features, and also remove features. For example, `try`,
`async`, and `await` are keywords in Rust 2018, but not Rust 2015. If you
have a project that's using Rust 2015, and you'd like to use Rust 2018 for it
instead, there's a few steps that you need to take.

Here's an example. Imagine we have a crate that has this code in
`src/lib.rs`:

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn foo(&self, Box<Foo>);
}
```

This code uses an anonymous parameter, that `Box<Foo>`. This is [not
supported in Rust 2018](../rust-2018/trait-system/no-anon-params.md), and
so this would fail to compile. Let's get this code up to date!

## Updating your code to be compatible with the new edition

Your code may or may not use features that are incompatible with the new
edition. In order to help transition to Rust 2018, we've included a new
subcommand with Cargo. To start, let's run it:

```console
> cargo fix --edition
```

This will check your code, and automatically fix any issues that it can.
Let's look at `src/lib.rs` again:

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn foo(&self, _: Box<Foo>);
}
```

It's re-written our code to introduce a parameter name for that trait object.
In this case, since it had no name, `cargo fix` will replace it with `_`,
which is conventional for unused variables.

`cargo fix` can't always fix your code automatically.
If `cargo fix` can't fix something, it will print the warning that it cannot fix
to the console. If you see one of these warnings, you'll have to update your code
manually. See the corresponding section of this guide for help, and if you have
problems, please seek help at the [user's forums](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

Keep running `cargo fix --edition` until you have no more warnings.

Congrats! Your code is now valid in both Rust 2015 and Rust 2018!

## Enabling the new edition to use new features

In order to use some new features, you must explicitly opt in to the new
edition. Once you're ready to commit, change your `Cargo.toml` to add the new
`edition` key/value pair. For example:

```toml
[package]
name = "foo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
edition = "2018"
```

If there's no `edition` key, Cargo will default to Rust 2015. But in this case,
we've chosen `2018`, and so our code is compiling with Rust 2018!

## Writing idiomatic code in a new edition

Editions are not only about new features and removing old ones. In any programming
language, idioms change over time, and Rust is no exception. While old code
will continue to compile, it might be written with different idioms today.

Our sample code contains an outdated idiom. Here it is again:

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn foo(&self, _: Box<Foo>);
}
```

In Rust 2018, it's considered idiomatic to use the [`dyn`
keyword](../rust-2018/trait-system/dyn-trait-for-trait-objects.md) for
trait objects.

Eventually, we want `cargo fix` to fix all these idioms automatically in the same
manner we did for upgrading to the 2018 edition. **Currently,
though, the *"idiom lints"* are not ready for widespread automatic fixing.** The
compiler isn't making `cargo fix`-compatible suggestions in many cases right
now, and it is making incorrect suggestions in others. Enabling the idiom lints,
even with `cargo fix`, is likely to leave your crate either broken or with many
warnings still remaining.

We have plans to make these idiom migrations a seamless part of the Rust 2018
experience, but we're not there yet. As a result the following instructions are
recommended only for the intrepid who are willing to work through a few
compiler/Cargo bugs!

With that out of the way, we can instruct Cargo to fix our code snippet with:

```console
$ cargo fix --edition-idioms
```

Afterwards, `src/lib.rs` looks like this:

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn foo(&self, _: Box<dyn Foo>);
}
```

We're now more idiomatic, and we didn't have to fix our code manually!

Note that `cargo fix` may still not be able to automatically update our code.
If `cargo fix` can't fix something, it will print a warning to the console, and
you'll have to fix it manually.

As mentioned before, there are known bugs around the idiom lints which
means they're not all ready for prime time yet. You may get a scary-looking
warning to report a bug to Cargo, which happens whenever a fix proposed by
`rustc` actually caused code to stop compiling by accident. If you'd like `cargo
fix` to make as much progress as possible, even if it causes code to stop
compiling, you can execute:

```console
$ cargo fix --edition-idioms --broken-code
```

This will instruct `cargo fix` to apply automatic suggestions regardless of
whether they work or not. Like usual, you'll see the compilation result after
all fixes are applied. If you notice anything wrong or unusual, please feel free
to report an issue to Cargo and we'll help prioritize and fix it.

Enjoy the new edition!
