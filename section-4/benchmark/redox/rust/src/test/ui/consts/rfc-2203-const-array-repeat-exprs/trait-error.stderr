LL |     [Foo(String::new()); 4];
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `std::marker::Copy` is not implemented for `Foo<std::string::String>`
   |
   = help: the following implementations were found:
             <Foo<T> as std::marker::Copy>
   = note: the `Copy` trait is required because the repeated element will be copied
