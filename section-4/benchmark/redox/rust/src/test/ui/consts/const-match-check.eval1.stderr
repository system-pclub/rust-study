error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `std::i32::MIN..=-1i32` and `1i32..=std::i32::MAX` not covered
  --> $DIR/const-match-check.rs:25:15
   |
LL |     A = { let 0 = 0; 0 },
   |               ^ patterns `std::i32::MIN..=-1i32` and `1i32..=std::i32::MAX` not covered
   |
   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant
   = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-02-refutability.html
help: you might want to use `if let` to ignore the variant that isn't matched
