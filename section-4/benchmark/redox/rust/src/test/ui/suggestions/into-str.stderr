   = note: to coerce a `std::string::String` into a `&str`, use `&*` as a prefix
   = note: `std::convert::From<std::string::String>` is implemented for `&mut str`, but not for `&str`
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::convert::Into<&str>` for `std::string::String`
