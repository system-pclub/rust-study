   = help: within `std::path::Path`, the trait `std::marker::Sized` is not implemented for `[u8]`
   = note: to learn more, visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-04-advanced-types.html#dynamically-sized-types-and-the-sized-trait>
   = note: required because it appears within the type `std::path::Path`
   = note: all local variables must have a statically known size
   = help: unsized locals are gated as an unstable feature
