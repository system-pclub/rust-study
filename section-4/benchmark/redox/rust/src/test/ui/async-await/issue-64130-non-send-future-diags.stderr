   |     ^^^^^^^ `std::sync::MutexGuard<'_, u32>` cannot be sent between threads safely

   = help: within `impl std::future::Future`, the trait `std::marker::Send` is not implemented for `std::sync::MutexGuard<'_, u32>`
note: future does not implement `std::marker::Send` as this value is used across an await

LL |     let g = x.lock().unwrap();
   |         - has type `std::sync::MutexGuard<'_, u32>`
LL |     baz().await;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ await occurs here, with `g` maybe used later
LL | }
   | - `g` is later dropped here
