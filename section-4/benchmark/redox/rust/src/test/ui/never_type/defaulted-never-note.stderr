error[E0277]: the trait bound `!: ImplementedForUnitButNotNever` is not satisfied

   = note: the trait is implemented for `()`. Possibly this error has been caused by changes to Rust's type-inference algorithm (see: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48950 for more info). Consider whether you meant to use the type `()` here instead.
