   |         | borrowed value does not live long enough
   |         a temporary with access to the borrow is created here ...
LL |     }
   |     - `_thing1` dropped here while still borrowed
LL | 
LL |     ;
   |     - ... and the borrow might be used here, when that temporary is dropped and runs the `Drop` code for type `D`
   |
   = note: The temporary is part of an expression at the end of a block. Consider adding semicolon after the expression so its temporaries are dropped sooner, before the local variables declared by the block are dropped.
