   | `stmt` dropped here while still borrowed
   | ... and the borrow might be used here, when that temporary is dropped and runs the destructor for type `std::iter::Map<Rows<'_>, [closure@$DIR/issue-54556-stephaneyfx.rs:28:14: 28:23]>`

   = note: The temporary is part of an expression at the end of a block. Consider forcing this temporary to be dropped sooner, before the block's local variables are dropped. For example, you could save the expression's value in a new local variable `x` and then make `x` be the expression at the end of the block.
