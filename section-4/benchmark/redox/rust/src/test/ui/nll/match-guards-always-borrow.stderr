error[E0507]: cannot move out of `foo` in pattern guard
  --> $DIR/match-guards-always-borrow.rs:8:14

LL |             (|| { let bar = foo; bar.take() })();

   |              |              move occurs because `foo` has type `&mut std::option::Option<&i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |              |              move occurs due to use in closure
   |              move out of `foo` occurs here
   |
   = note: variables bound in patterns cannot be moved from until after the end of the pattern guard

error: aborting due to previous error
