   |                    borrowed value does not live long enough
   |                    a temporary with access to the borrow is created here ...

LL | }
   | -
   | |
   | `counter` dropped here while still borrowed
   | ... and the borrow might be used here, when that temporary is dropped and runs the destructor for type `std::result::Result<MutexGuard<'_>, ()>`
   |
   = note: The temporary is part of an expression at the end of a block. Consider adding semicolon after the expression so its temporaries are dropped sooner, before the local variables declared by the block are dropped.
