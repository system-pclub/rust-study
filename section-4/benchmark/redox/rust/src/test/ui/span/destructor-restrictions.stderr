error[E0597]: `*a` does not live long enough
  --> $DIR/destructor-restrictions.rs:8:10

LL |         *a.borrow() + 1
   |          ^---------
   |          |
   |          borrowed value does not live long enough
   |          a temporary with access to the borrow is created here ...
LL |     };
   |     -- ... and the borrow might be used here, when that temporary is dropped and runs the destructor for type `std::cell::Ref<'_, i32>`
   |     |
   |     `*a` dropped here while still borrowed
   |
   = note: The temporary is part of an expression at the end of a block. Consider forcing this temporary to be dropped sooner, before the block's local variables are dropped. For example, you could save the expression's value in a new local variable `x` and then make `x` be the expression at the end of the block.
