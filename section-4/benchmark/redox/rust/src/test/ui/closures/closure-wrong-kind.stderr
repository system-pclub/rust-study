error[E0525]: expected a closure that implements the `Fn` trait, but this closure only implements `FnOnce`
  --> $DIR/closure-wrong-kind.rs:10:19

   |                   |       |
   |                   |       closure is `FnOnce` because it moves the variable `x` out of its environment
   |                   this closure implements `FnOnce`, not `Fn`
LL |     bar(closure);
   |     --- the requirement to implement `Fn` derives from here
