error[E0525]: expected a closure that implements the `Fn` trait, but this closure only implements `FnOnce`

   |             |       |
   |             |       closure is `FnOnce` because it moves the variable `y` out of its environment
   |             this closure implements `FnOnce`, not `Fn`
LL |     foo(c);
   |     --- the requirement to implement `Fn` derives from here
