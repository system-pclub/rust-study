error: captured variable cannot escape `FnMut` closure body
  --> $DIR/issue-40510-3.rs:11:9

   | |_________^ returns a closure that contains a reference to a captured variable, which then escapes the closure body

   = note: `FnMut` closures only have access to their captured variables while they are executing...
   = note: ...therefore, they cannot allow references to captured variables to escape

error: aborting due to previous error
