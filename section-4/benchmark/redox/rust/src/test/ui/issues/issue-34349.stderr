error[E0525]: expected a closure that implements the `Fn` trait, but this closure only implements `FnMut`

LL |     let diary = || {
   |                 ^^ this closure implements `FnMut`, not `Fn`
LL |         farewell.push_str("!!!");
   |         -------- closure is `FnMut` because it mutates the variable `farewell` here
...
LL |     apply(diary);
   |     ----- the requirement to implement `Fn` derives from here
