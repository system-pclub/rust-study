LL |     let x = vec!["hi".to_string()];
   |         - move occurs because `x` has type `std::vec::Vec<std::string::String>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     consume(x.into_iter().next().unwrap());
   |             - value moved here
LL |     touch(&x[0]);
   |            ^ value borrowed here after move
