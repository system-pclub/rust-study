   = note: The value of statics and constants must be known at compile time, and they live for the entire lifetime of a program. Creating a boxed value allocates memory on the heap at runtime, and therefore cannot be done at compile time.

   = note: A function call isn't allowed in the const's initialization expression because the expression's value must be known at compile-time.
   = note: Remember: you can't use a function call inside a const's initialization expression! However, you can use it anywhere else.
