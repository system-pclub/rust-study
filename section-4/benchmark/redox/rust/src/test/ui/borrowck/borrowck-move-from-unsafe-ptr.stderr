error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*x` which is behind a raw pointer
  --> $DIR/borrowck-move-from-unsafe-ptr.rs:2:13

LL |     let y = *x;
   |             ^^
   |             |
   |             move occurs because `*x` has type `std::boxed::Box<isize>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |             help: consider borrowing here: `&*x`

error: aborting due to previous error
