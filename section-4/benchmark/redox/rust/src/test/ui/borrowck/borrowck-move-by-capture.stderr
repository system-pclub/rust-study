error[E0507]: cannot move out of `bar`, a captured variable in an `FnMut` closure

LL |     let bar: Box<_> = box 3;
   |         --- captured outer variable
LL |     let _g = to_fn_mut(|| {
LL |         let _h = to_fn_once(move || -> isize { *bar });

   |                             |                   move occurs because `bar` has type `std::boxed::Box<isize>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |                             |                   move occurs due to use in closure
   |                             move out of `bar` occurs here
