LL | struct MyStruct;
   | ---------------- method `foo_one` not found for this
...

   |                             ^^^^^^^ method not found in `MyStruct`

   = note: the method `foo_one` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `MyStruct : Foo`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `foo_one`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `Foo`
