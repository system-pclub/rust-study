error: lifetime may not live long enough

   |                          lifetime `'_` defined here

help: to allow this `impl Trait` to capture borrowed data with lifetime `'_`, add `'_` as a constraint

LL |     async fn f(self: Pin<&Self>) -> impl Clone + '_ { self }
   |                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
