error: lifetime may not live long enough

LL |     fn f(self: Pin<&Self>) -> impl Clone { self }
   |                    -          ^^^^^^^^^^ opaque type requires that `'1` must outlive `'static`
   |                    |
   |                    let's call the lifetime of this reference `'1`
   |
help: to allow this `impl Trait` to capture borrowed data with lifetime `'1`, add `'_` as a constraint
   |
LL |     fn f(self: Pin<&Self>) -> impl Clone + '_ { self }
   |                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
