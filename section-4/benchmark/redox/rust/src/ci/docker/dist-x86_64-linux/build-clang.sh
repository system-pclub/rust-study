# For whatever reason the default set of include paths for clang is different
# than that of gcc. As a result we need to manually include our sysroot's
# include path, /rustroot/include, to clang's default include path.
#
# Alsow there's this weird oddity with gcc where there's an 'include-fixed'
# directory that it generates. It turns out [1] that Centos 5's headers are so
# old that they're incompatible with modern C semantics. While gcc automatically
# fixes that clang doesn't account for this. Tell clang to manually include the
# fixed headers so we can successfully compile code later on.
