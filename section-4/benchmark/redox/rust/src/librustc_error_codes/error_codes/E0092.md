You tried to declare an undefined atomic operation function.
Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0092
#![feature(intrinsics)]

extern "rust-intrinsic" {
    fn atomic_foo(); // error: unrecognized atomic operation
                     //        function
}
```

Please check you didn't make a mistake in the function's name. All intrinsic
functions are defined in librustc_codegen_llvm/intrinsic.rs and in
libcore/intrinsics.rs in the Rust source code. Example:

```
#![feature(intrinsics)]

extern "rust-intrinsic" {
    fn atomic_fence(); // ok!
}
```
