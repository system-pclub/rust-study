This error occurs when the compiler was unable to infer the concrete type of a
variable. It can occur for several cases, the most common of which is a
mismatch in the expected type that the compiler inferred for a variable's
initializing expression, and the actual type explicitly assigned to the
variable.

For example:

```compile_fail,E0308
let x: i32 = "I am not a number!";
//     ~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//      |             |
//      |    initializing expression;
//      |    compiler infers type `&str`
//      |
//    type `i32` assigned to variable `x`
```
