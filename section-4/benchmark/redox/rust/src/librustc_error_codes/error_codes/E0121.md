In order to be consistent with Rust's lack of global type inference,
type and const placeholders are disallowed by design in item signatures.

Examples of this error include:

```compile_fail,E0121
fn foo() -> _ { 5 } // error, explicitly write out the return type instead

static BAR: _ = "test"; // error, explicitly write out the type instead
```
