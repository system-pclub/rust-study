This error indicates that the struct, enum or enum variant cannot be
instantiated from outside of the defining crate as it has been marked
as `non_exhaustive` and as such more fields/variants may be added in
future that could cause adverse side effects for this code.

It is recommended that you look for a `new` function or equivalent in the
crate's documentation.
