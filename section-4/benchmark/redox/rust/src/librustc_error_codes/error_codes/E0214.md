A generic type was described using parentheses rather than angle brackets.
For example:

```compile_fail,E0214
fn main() {
    let v: Vec(&str) = vec!["foo"];
}
```

This is not currently supported: `v` should be defined as `Vec<&str>`.
Parentheses are currently only used with generic types when defining parameters
for `Fn`-family traits.
