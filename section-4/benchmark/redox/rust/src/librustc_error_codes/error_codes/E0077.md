When using the `#[simd]` attribute on a tuple struct, the elements in the tuple
must be machine types so SIMD operations can be applied to them.

This will cause an error:

```compile_fail,E0077
#![feature(repr_simd)]

#[repr(simd)]
struct Bad(String);
```

This will not:

```
#![feature(repr_simd)]

#[repr(simd)]
struct Good(u32, u32, u32);
```
