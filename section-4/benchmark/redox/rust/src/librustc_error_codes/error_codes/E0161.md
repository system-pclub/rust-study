A value was moved. However, its size was not known at compile time, and only
values of a known size can be moved.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0161
#![feature(box_syntax)]

fn main() {
    let array: &[isize] = &[1, 2, 3];
    let _x: Box<[isize]> = box *array;
    // error: cannot move a value of type [isize]: the size of [isize] cannot
    //        be statically determined
}
```

In Rust, you can only move a value when its size is known at compile time.

To work around this restriction, consider "hiding" the value behind a reference:
either `&x` or `&mut x`. Since a reference has a fixed size, this lets you move
it around as usual. Example:

```
#![feature(box_syntax)]

fn main() {
    let array: &[isize] = &[1, 2, 3];
    let _x: Box<&[isize]> = box array; // ok!
}
```
