When defining a recursive struct or enum, any use of the type being defined
from inside the definition must occur behind a pointer (like `Box` or `&`).
This is because structs and enums must have a well-defined size, and without
the pointer, the size of the type would need to be unbounded.

Consider the following erroneous definition of a type for a list of bytes:

```compile_fail,E0072
// error, invalid recursive struct type
struct ListNode {
    head: u8,
    tail: Option<ListNode>,
}
```

This type cannot have a well-defined size, because it needs to be arbitrarily
large (since we would be able to nest `ListNode`s to any depth). Specifically,

```plain
size of `ListNode` = 1 byte for `head`
                   + 1 byte for the discriminant of the `Option`
                   + size of `ListNode`
```

One way to fix this is by wrapping `ListNode` in a `Box`, like so:

```
struct ListNode {
    head: u8,
    tail: Option<Box<ListNode>>,
}
```

This works because `Box` is a pointer, so its size is well-known.
