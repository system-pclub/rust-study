The `#[simd]` attribute can only be applied to non empty tuple structs, because
it doesn't make sense to try to use SIMD operations when there are no values to
operate on.

This will cause an error:

```compile_fail,E0075
#![feature(repr_simd)]

#[repr(simd)]
struct Bad;
```

This will not:

```
#![feature(repr_simd)]

#[repr(simd)]
struct Good(u32);
```
