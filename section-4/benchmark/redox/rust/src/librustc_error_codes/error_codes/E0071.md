You tried to use structure-literal syntax to create an item that is
not a structure or enum variant.

Example of erroneous code:

```compile_fail,E0071
type U32 = u32;
let t = U32 { value: 4 }; // error: expected struct, variant or union type,
                          // found builtin type `u32`
```

To fix this, ensure that the name was correctly spelled, and that
the correct form of initializer was used.

For example, the code above can be fixed to:

```
enum Foo {
    FirstValue(i32)
}

fn main() {
    let u = Foo::FirstValue(0i32);

    let t = 4;
}
```
