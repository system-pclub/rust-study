    /// **Why is this bad?** `Drop` bounds do not really accomplish anything.
    /// A type may have compiler-generated drop glue without implementing the
    /// `Drop` trait itself. The `Drop` trait also only has one method,
    /// `Drop::drop`, and that function is by fiat not callable in user code.
    /// So there is really no use case for using `Drop` in trait bounds.
    ///
    /// The most likely use case of a drop bound is to distinguish between types
    /// that have destructors and types that don't. Combined with specialization,
    /// a naive coder would write an implementation that assumed a type could be
    /// trivially dropped, then write a specialization for `T: Drop` that actually
    /// calls the destructor. Except that doing so is not correct; String, for
    /// example, doesn't actually implement Drop, but because String contains a
    /// Vec, assuming it can be trivially dropped will leak memory.
    ///
    /// **Known problems:** None.
    ///
    /// **Example:**
    /// ```rust
    /// fn foo<T: Drop>() {}
