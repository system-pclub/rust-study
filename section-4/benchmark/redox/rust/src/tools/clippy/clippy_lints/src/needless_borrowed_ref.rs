    /// **What it does:** Checks for useless borrowed references.
    ///
    /// **Why is this bad?** It is mostly useless and make the code look more
    /// complex than it
    /// actually is.
    ///
    /// **Known problems:** It seems that the `&ref` pattern is sometimes useful.
    /// For instance in the following snippet:
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// enum Animal {
    ///     Cat(u64),
    ///     Dog(u64),
    /// }
    ///
    /// fn foo(a: &Animal, b: &Animal) {
    ///     match (a, b) {
    ///         (&Animal::Cat(v), k) | (k, &Animal::Cat(v)) => (), // lifetime mismatch error
    ///         (&Animal::Dog(ref c), &Animal::Dog(_)) => ()
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// There is a lifetime mismatch error for `k` (indeed a and b have distinct
    /// lifetime).
    /// This can be fixed by using the `&ref` pattern.
    /// However, the code can also be fixed by much cleaner ways
    ///
    /// **Example:**
    /// ```rust
    /// let mut v = Vec::<String>::new();
    /// let _ = v.iter_mut().filter(|&ref a| a.is_empty());
    /// ```
    /// This closure takes a reference on something that has been matched as a
    /// reference and
    /// de-referenced.
    /// As such, it could just be |a| a.is_empty()
