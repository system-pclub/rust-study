Thank you for making Clippy better!

We're collecting our changelog from pull request descriptions.
If your PR only updates to the latest nightly, you can leave the
`changelog` entry as `none`. Otherwise, please write a short comment
explaining your change.

If your PR fixes an issue, you can add "fixes #issue_number" into this
PR description. This way the issue will be automatically closed when
your PR is merged.
