== NAME

cargo-install - Build and install a Rust binary

== SYNOPSIS

[%hardbreaks]
`cargo install [_OPTIONS_] _CRATE_...`
`cargo install [_OPTIONS_] --path _PATH_`
`cargo install [_OPTIONS_] --git _URL_ [_CRATE_...]`
`cargo install [_OPTIONS_] --list`

== DESCRIPTION

This command manages Cargo's local set of installed binary crates. Only
packages which have executable `\[[bin]]` or `\[[example]]` targets can be
installed, and all executables are installed into the installation root's
`bin` folder.

include::description-install-root.adoc[]

There are multiple sources from which a crate can be installed. The default
location is crates.io but the `--git`, `--path`, and `--registry` flags can
change this source. If the source contains more than one package (such as
crates.io or a git repository with multiple crates) the _CRATE_ argument is
required to indicate which crate should be installed.

Crates from crates.io can optionally specify the version they wish to install
via the `--version` flags, and similarly packages from git repositories can
optionally specify the branch, tag, or revision that should be installed. If a
crate has multiple binaries, the `--bin` argument can selectively install only
one of them, and if you'd rather install examples the `--example` argument can
be used as well.

If the source is crates.io or `--git` then by default the crate will be built
in a temporary target directory. To avoid this, the target directory can be
specified by setting the `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` environment variable to a relative
path. In particular, this can be useful for caching build artifacts on
continuous integration systems.

By default, the `Cargo.lock` file that is included with the package will be
ignored. This means that Cargo will recompute which versions of dependencies
to use, possibly using newer versions that have been released since the
package was published. The `--locked` flag can be used to force Cargo to use
the packaged `Cargo.lock` file if it is available. This may be useful for
ensuring reproducible builds, to use the exact same set of dependencies that
were available when the package was published. It may also be useful if a
newer version of a dependency is published that no longer builds on your
system, or has other problems. The downside to using `--locked` is that you
will not receive any fixes or updates to any dependency. Note that Cargo did
not start publishing `Cargo.lock` files until version 1.37, which means
packages published with prior versions will not have a `Cargo.lock` file
available.
