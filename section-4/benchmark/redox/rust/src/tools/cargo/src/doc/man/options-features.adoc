every selected package.

*--features* _FEATURES_::

    may be enabled with `<dep-name>/<feature-name>` syntax.

*--all-features*::
    Activate all available features of all selected packages.

*--no-default-features*::
    Do not activate the `default` feature of the current directory's
    package.
