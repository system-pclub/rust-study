.SH "NAME"
cargo\-test \- Execute unit and integration tests of a package
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcargo test [\fIOPTIONS\fP] [TESTNAME] [\-\- \fITEST\-OPTIONS\fP]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Compile and execute unit and integration tests.
.sp
The test filtering argument \fBTESTNAME\fP and all the arguments following the two
dashes (\fB\-\-\fP) are passed to the test binaries and thus to \fIlibtest\fP (rustc\(cqs
built in unit\-test and micro\-benchmarking framework).  If you\(cqre passing
arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the ones after \fB\-\-\fP go to the binary,
the ones before go to Cargo.  For details about libtest\(cqs arguments see the
output of \fBcargo test \(em \-\-help\fP.  As an example, this will run all tests with
\fBfoo\fP in their name on 3 threads in parallel:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
cargo test foo \-\- \-\-test\-threads 3
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Tests are built with the \fB\-\-test\fP option to \fBrustc\fP which creates an
executable with a \fBmain\fP function that automatically runs all functions
annotated with the \fB#[test]\fP attribute in multiple threads. \fB#[bench]\fP
annotated functions will also be run with one iteration to verify that they
are functional.
.sp
The libtest harness may be disabled by setting \fBharness = false\fP in the target
manifest settings, in which case your code will need to provide its own \fBmain\fP
function to handle running tests.
.sp
Documentation tests are also run by default, which is handled by \fBrustdoc\fP. It
extracts code samples from documentation comments and executes them. See the
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/rustdoc/" "rustdoc book" " "
for more information on
writing doc tests.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Test Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-run\fP
.RS 4
Compile, but don\(cqt run tests.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-fail\-fast\fP
.RS 4
Run all tests regardless of failure. Without this flag, Cargo will exit
after the first executable fails. The Rust test harness will run all
tests within the executable to completion, this flag only applies to
the executable as a whole.
.RE
.SS "Package Selection"
.sp
By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fP is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
by the manifest will be selected.
.sp
The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
\fBworkspace.default\-members\fP key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
\fB\-\-workspace\fP), and a non\-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.
.sp
\fB\-p\fP \fISPEC\fP..., \fB\-\-package\fP \fISPEC\fP...
.RS 4
Test only the specified packages. See \fBcargo\-pkgid\fP(1) for the
SPEC format. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-workspace\fP
.RS 4
Test all members in the workspace.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\fP
.RS 4
Deprecated alias for \fB\-\-workspace\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-exclude\fP \fISPEC\fP...
.RS 4
Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
\fB\-\-workspace\fP flag. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.SS "Target Selection"
.sp
When no target selection options are given, \fBcargo test\fP will build the
following targets of the selected packages:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}

doc tests for the lib target
.RE
.sp
The default behavior can be changed by setting the \fBtest\fP flag for the target
in the manifest settings. Setting examples to \fBtest = true\fP will build and run
the example as a test. Setting targets to \fBtest = false\fP will stop them from
being tested by default. Target selection options that take a target by name
ignore the \fBtest\fP flag and will always test the given target.
.sp
Doc tests for libraries may be disabled by setting \fBdoctest = false\fP for the
library in the manifest.
.sp
Passing target selection flags will test only the
specified targets.
.sp
\fB\-\-lib\fP
.RS 4
Test the package\(cqs library.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bin\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Test the specified binary. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bins\fP
.RS 4
Test all binary targets.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-example\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Test the specified example. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-examples\fP
.RS 4
Test all example targets.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-test\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Test the specified integration test. This flag may be specified multiple
times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-tests\fP
.RS 4
Test all targets in test mode that have the \fBtest = true\fP manifest
flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built as
unittests, and integration tests. Be aware that this will also build any
required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a
unittest, and once as a dependency for binaries, integration tests, etc.).
Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the \fBtest\fP flag in the
manifest settings for the target.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bench\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Test the specified benchmark. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-benches\fP
.RS 4
Test all targets in benchmark mode that have the \fBbench = true\fP
manifest flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built
as benchmarks, and bench targets. Be aware that this will also build any
required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a
benchmark, and once as a dependency for binaries, benchmarks, etc.).
Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the \fBbench\fP flag in the
manifest settings for the target.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-targets\fP
.RS 4
Test all targets. This is equivalent to specifying \fB\-\-lib \-\-bins
\-\-tests \-\-benches \-\-examples\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-doc\fP
.RS 4
Test only the library\(cqs documentation. This cannot be mixed with other
target options.
.RE
.SS "Feature Selection"
.sp
When no feature options are given, the \fBdefault\fP feature is activated for
every selected package.
.sp
\fB\-\-features\fP \fIFEATURES\fP
.RS 4
Space or comma separated list of features to activate. These features only
apply to the current directory\(cqs package. Features of direct dependencies
may be enabled with \fB<dep\-name>/<feature\-name>\fP syntax.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-features\fP
.RS 4
Activate all available features of all selected packages.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-default\-features\fP
.RS 4
Do not activate the \fBdefault\fP feature of the current directory\(cqs
package.
.RE
.SS "Compilation Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\fP \fITRIPLE\fP
.RS 4
Test for the given architecture. The default is the host
architecture. The general format of the triple is
\fB<arch><sub>\-<vendor>\-<sys>\-<abi>\fP. Run \fBrustc \-\-print target\-list\fP for a
list of supported targets.
.sp
This may also be specified with the \fBbuild.target\fP
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-release\fP
.RS 4
Test optimized artifacts with the \fBrelease\fP profile. See the
PROFILES section for details on how this affects profile selection.
.RE
.SS "Output Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\-dir\fP \fIDIRECTORY\fP
.RS 4
Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May also be
specified with the \fBCARGO_TARGET_DIR\fP environment variable, or the
\fBbuild.target\-dir\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
Defaults
to \fBtarget\fP in the root of the workspace.
.RE
.SS "Display Options"
.sp
By default the Rust test harness hides output from test execution to keep
results readable. Test output can be recovered (e.g., for debugging) by passing
\fB\-\-nocapture\fP to the test binaries:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
cargo test \-\- \-\-nocapture
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.verbose\fP
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.sp
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
.RS 4

JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Cargo\(cqs own JSON diagnostics and others
coming from rustc are still emitted.
.RE
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fP \fIPATH\fP
.RS 4
Path to the \fBCargo.toml\fP file. By default, Cargo searches for the
\fBCargo.toml\fP file in the current directory or any parent directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fP, \fB\-\-locked\fP
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \fBCargo.lock\fP file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \fB\-\-frozen\fP flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\fBCargo.lock\fP file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fP
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fP(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
.sp
May also be specified with the \fBnet.offline\fP \c

Unstable (nightly\-only) flags to Cargo. Run \fBcargo \-Z help\fP for
details.
.RE
.SS "Miscellaneous Options"
.sp
The \fB\-\-jobs\fP argument affects the building of the test executable but does not
affect how many threads are used when running the tests. The Rust test harness
includes an option to control the number of threads used:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
cargo test \-j 2 \-\- \-\-test\-threads=2
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
\fB\-j\fP \fIN\fP, \fB\-\-jobs\fP \fIN\fP
.RS 4
Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
\fBbuild.jobs\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
Defaults to
the number of CPUs.
.RE
.SH "PROFILES"
.sp
Profiles may be used to configure compiler options such as optimization levels
and debug settings. See
\c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the\-profile\-sections" "the reference"
for more details.
.sp
Profile selection depends on the target and crate being built. By default the
\fBdev\fP or \fBtest\fP profiles are used. If the \fB\-\-release\fP flag is given, then the
\fBrelease\fP or \fBbench\fP profiles are used.

\fBdev\fP/\fBrelease\fP profiles) unless you are building them with the test harness
(by setting \fBtest = true\fP in the manifest or using the \fB\-\-example\fP flag) in
which case they use the \fBtest\fP/\fBbench\fP profiles. Library targets are built
with the \fBdev\fP/\fBrelease\fP profiles when linked to an integration test, binary,
