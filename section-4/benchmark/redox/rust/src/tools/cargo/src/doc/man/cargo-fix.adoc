== NAME

cargo-fix - Automatically fix lint warnings reported by rustc

== SYNOPSIS

`cargo fix [_OPTIONS_]`

== DESCRIPTION

This Cargo subcommand will automatically take rustc's suggestions from
diagnostics like warnings and apply them to your source code. This is intended
to help automate tasks that rustc itself already knows how to tell you to fix!
The `cargo fix` subcommand is also being developed for the Rust 2018 edition
to provide code the ability to easily opt-in to the new edition without having
to worry about any breakage.

Executing `cargo fix` will under the hood execute man:cargo-check[1]. Any warnings
applicable to your crate will be automatically fixed (if possible) and all
remaining warnings will be displayed when the check process is finished. For
example if you'd like to prepare for the 2018 edition, you can do so by
executing:

    cargo fix --edition

which behaves the same as `cargo check --all-targets`. Similarly if you'd like
to fix code for different platforms you can do:

    cargo fix --edition --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

or if your crate has optional features:

    cargo fix --edition --no-default-features --features foo

If you encounter any problems with `cargo fix` or otherwise have any questions
or feature requests please don't hesitate to file an issue at
https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo

== OPTIONS

=== Fix options

*--broken-code*::
    Fix code even if it already has compiler errors. This is useful if `cargo
    fix` fails to apply the changes. It will apply the changes and leave the
    broken code in the working directory for you to inspect and manually fix.

*--edition*::
    Apply changes that will update the code to the latest edition. This will
    not update the edition in the `Cargo.toml` manifest, which must be updated
    manually.

*--edition-idioms*::
    Apply suggestions that will update code to the preferred style for the
    current edition.

*--allow-no-vcs*::
    Fix code even if a VCS was not detected.

*--allow-dirty*::
    Fix code even if the working directory has changes.

*--allow-staged*::
    Fix code even if the working directory has staged changes.
