== NAME

cargo-metadata - Machine-readable metadata about the current package

== SYNOPSIS

`cargo metadata [_OPTIONS_]`

== DESCRIPTION

Output the resolved dependencies of a package, the concrete used versions
including overrides, in JSON to stdout.

It is recommended to include the `--format-version` flag to future-proof
your code to ensure the output is in the format you are expecting.

See the link:https://crates.io/crates/cargo_metadata[cargo_metadata crate]
for a Rust API for reading the metadata.

== OUTPUT FORMAT

The output has the following format:

== OPTIONS

=== Output Options

*--no-deps*::
    Output information only about the workspace members and don't fetch
    dependencies.

*--format-version* _VERSION_::
    Specify the version of the output format to use. Currently `1` is the only
    possible value.

*--filter-platform* _TRIPLE_::
    This filters the `resolve` output to only include dependencies for the
    given target triple. Without this flag, the resolve includes all targets.
+
Note that the dependencies listed in the "packages" array still includes all
dependencies. Each package definition is intended to be an unaltered
reproduction of the information within `Cargo.toml`.
