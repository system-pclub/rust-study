.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBcargo package [\fIOPTIONS\fP]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command will create a distributable, compressed \fB.crate\fP file with the
source code of the package in the current directory. The resulting file will
be stored in the \fBtarget/package\fP directory. This performs the following
steps:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2

Load and check the current workspace, performing some basic checks.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3

Path dependencies are not allowed unless they have a version key. Cargo
will ignore the path key for dependencies in published packages.
\fBdev\-dependencies\fP do not have this restriction.

.RS 4
.ie n \{\

\fBCargo.lock\fP is automatically included if the package contains an
executable binary or example target. \fBcargo\-install\fP(1) will use the
packaged lock file if the \fB\-\-locked\fP flag is used.

A \fB.cargo_vcs_info.json\fP file is included that contains information

The list of files included can be controlled with the \fBinclude\fP and \fBexclude\fP
fields in the manifest.

packaging and publishing.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Package Options"
.sp
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-list\fP
.RS 4
Print files included in a package without making one.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-verify\fP
.RS 4
Don\(cqt verify the contents by building them.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-metadata\fP
.RS 4
Ignore warnings about a lack of human\-usable metadata (such as the
description or the license).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-allow\-dirty\fP
.RS 4
Allow working directories with uncommitted VCS changes to be packaged.
.RE
.SS "Compilation Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\fP \fITRIPLE\fP
.RS 4
Package for the given architecture. The default is the host
architecture. The general format of the triple is
\fB<arch><sub>\-<vendor>\-<sys>\-<abi>\fP. Run \fBrustc \-\-print target\-list\fP for a
list of supported targets.
.sp
This may also be specified with the \fBbuild.target\fP
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-target\-dir\fP \fIDIRECTORY\fP
.RS 4
Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May also be
specified with the \fBCARGO_TARGET_DIR\fP environment variable, or the
\fBbuild.target\-dir\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
Defaults
to \fBtarget\fP in the root of the workspace.
.RE
.SS "Feature Selection"
.sp
When no feature options are given, the \fBdefault\fP feature is activated for
every selected package.
.sp
\fB\-\-features\fP \fIFEATURES\fP
.RS 4
Space or comma separated list of features to activate. These features only
apply to the current directory\(cqs package. Features of direct dependencies
may be enabled with \fB<dep\-name>/<feature\-name>\fP syntax.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-features\fP
.RS 4
Activate all available features of all selected packages.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-default\-features\fP
.RS 4
Do not activate the \fBdefault\fP feature of the current directory\(cqs
package.
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fP \fIPATH\fP
.RS 4
Path to the \fBCargo.toml\fP file. By default, Cargo searches for the
\fBCargo.toml\fP file in the current directory or any parent directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fP, \fB\-\-locked\fP
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \fBCargo.lock\fP file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \fB\-\-frozen\fP flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\fBCargo.lock\fP file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fP
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fP(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
.sp
May also be specified with the \fBnet.offline\fP \c

.RE
.SS "Miscellaneous Options"
.sp
\fB\-j\fP \fIN\fP, \fB\-\-jobs\fP \fIN\fP
.RS 4
Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the

Defaults to
the number of CPUs.
.RE
.SS "Display Options"
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
