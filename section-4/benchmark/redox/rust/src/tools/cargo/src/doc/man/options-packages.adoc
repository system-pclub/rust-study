By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
`--manifest-path` is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
by the manifest will be selected.

The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
`workspace.default-members` key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
`--workspace`), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

*-p* _SPEC_...::
*--package* _SPEC_...::
    {actionverb} only the specified packages. See man:cargo-pkgid[1] for the
    SPEC format. This flag may be specified multiple times.

*--workspace*::
    {actionverb} all members in the workspace.

*--all*::
    Deprecated alias for `--workspace`.

*--exclude* _SPEC_...::
    Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
    `--workspace` flag. This flag may be specified multiple times.
