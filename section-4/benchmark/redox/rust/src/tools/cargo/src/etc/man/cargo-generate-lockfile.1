.SH "NAME"
cargo\-generate\-lockfile \- Generate the lockfile for a package
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcargo generate\-lockfile [\fIOPTIONS\fP]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command will create the \fBCargo.lock\fP lockfile for the current package or
workspace. If the lockfile already exists, it will be rebuilt if there are any
manifest changes or dependency updates.
.sp
See also \fBcargo\-update\fP(1) which is also capable of creating a \fBCargo.lock\fP
lockfile and has more options for controlling update behavior.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Display Options"
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.verbose\fP

\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP

\fB\-\-color\fP \fIWHEN\fP

.ie n \{\

.el \{\

terminal.

.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fP \fIPATH\fP
.RS 4
Path to the \fBCargo.toml\fP file. By default, Cargo searches for the
\fBCargo.toml\fP file in the current directory or any parent directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fP, \fB\-\-locked\fP
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \fBCargo.lock\fP file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \fB\-\-frozen\fP flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\fBCargo.lock\fP file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fP
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fP(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
