.SH "NAME"
cargo\-build \- Compile the current package
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcargo build [\fIOPTIONS\fP]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Compile local packages and all of their dependencies.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Package Selection"
.sp
By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fP is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
by the manifest will be selected.
.sp
The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
\fBworkspace.default\-members\fP key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
\fB\-\-workspace\fP), and a non\-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.
.sp
\fB\-p\fP \fISPEC\fP..., \fB\-\-package\fP \fISPEC\fP...
.RS 4
Build only the specified packages. See \fBcargo\-pkgid\fP(1) for the
SPEC format. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-workspace\fP
.RS 4
Build all members in the workspace.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\fP
.RS 4
Deprecated alias for \fB\-\-workspace\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-exclude\fP \fISPEC\fP...
.RS 4
Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
\fB\-\-workspace\fP flag. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.SS "Target Selection"
.sp
When no target selection options are given, \fBcargo build\fP will build all
binary and library targets of the selected packages. Binaries are skipped if
they have \fBrequired\-features\fP that are missing.
.sp
Passing target selection flags will build only the
specified targets.
.sp
\fB\-\-lib\fP
.RS 4
Build the package\(cqs library.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bin\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Build the specified binary. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bins\fP
.RS 4
Build all binary targets.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-example\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Build the specified example. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-examples\fP
.RS 4
Build all example targets.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-test\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Build the specified integration test. This flag may be specified multiple
times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-tests\fP
.RS 4
Build all targets in test mode that have the \fBtest = true\fP manifest
flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built as
unittests, and integration tests. Be aware that this will also build any
required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a
unittest, and once as a dependency for binaries, integration tests, etc.).
Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the \fBtest\fP flag in the
manifest settings for the target.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bench\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Build the specified benchmark. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-benches\fP
.RS 4
Build all targets in benchmark mode that have the \fBbench = true\fP
manifest flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built
as benchmarks, and bench targets. Be aware that this will also build any
required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a
benchmark, and once as a dependency for binaries, benchmarks, etc.).
Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the \fBbench\fP flag in the
manifest settings for the target.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-targets\fP
.RS 4
Build all targets. This is equivalent to specifying \fB\-\-lib \-\-bins
\-\-tests \-\-benches \-\-examples\fP.
.RE
.SS "Feature Selection"
.sp
When no feature options are given, the \fBdefault\fP feature is activated for
every selected package.
.sp
\fB\-\-features\fP \fIFEATURES\fP
.RS 4
Space or comma separated list of features to activate. These features only
apply to the current directory\(cqs package. Features of direct dependencies
may be enabled with \fB<dep\-name>/<feature\-name>\fP syntax.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-features\fP
.RS 4
Activate all available features of all selected packages.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-default\-features\fP
.RS 4
Do not activate the \fBdefault\fP feature of the current directory\(cqs
package.
.RE
.SS "Compilation Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\fP \fITRIPLE\fP
.RS 4
Build for the given architecture. The default is the host
architecture. The general format of the triple is
\fB<arch><sub>\-<vendor>\-<sys>\-<abi>\fP. Run \fBrustc \-\-print target\-list\fP for a
list of supported targets.
.sp
This may also be specified with the \fBbuild.target\fP
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-release\fP
.RS 4
Build optimized artifacts with the \fBrelease\fP profile. See the
PROFILES section for details on how this affects profile selection.
.RE
.SS "Output Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\-dir\fP \fIDIRECTORY\fP
.RS 4
Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May also be
specified with the \fBCARGO_TARGET_DIR\fP environment variable, or the
\fBbuild.target\-dir\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
Defaults
to \fBtarget\fP in the root of the workspace.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-out\-dir\fP \fIDIRECTORY\fP
.RS 4
Copy final artifacts to this directory.
.sp
This option is unstable and available only on the
\c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/book/appendix\-07\-nightly\-rust.html" "nightly channel"
and requires the \fB\-Z unstable\-options\fP flag to enable.

for more information.
.RE
.SS "Display Options"
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.verbose\fP
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."

\fB\-\-build\-plan\fP

run the build.
.sp
This option is unstable and available only on the

for more information.
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fP \fIPATH\fP
.RS 4
Path to the \fBCargo.toml\fP file. By default, Cargo searches for the
\fBCargo.toml\fP file in the current directory or any parent directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fP, \fB\-\-locked\fP
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \fBCargo.lock\fP file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \fB\-\-frozen\fP flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\fBCargo.lock\fP file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fP
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fP(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
.sp
May also be specified with the \fBnet.offline\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.SS "Common Options"
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Prints help information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-Z\fP \fIFLAG\fP...
.RS 4
Unstable (nightly\-only) flags to Cargo. Run \fBcargo \-Z help\fP for
details.
.RE
.SS "Miscellaneous Options"
.sp
\fB\-j\fP \fIN\fP, \fB\-\-jobs\fP \fIN\fP
.RS 4
Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
\fBbuild.jobs\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
Defaults to
the number of CPUs.
.RE
.SH "PROFILES"
.sp
Profiles may be used to configure compiler options such as optimization levels
and debug settings. See
\c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the\-profile\-sections" "the reference"
for more details.
.sp
Profile selection depends on the target and crate being built. By default the
\fBdev\fP or \fBtest\fP profiles are used. If the \fB\-\-release\fP flag is given, then the
\fBrelease\fP or \fBbench\fP profiles are used.
