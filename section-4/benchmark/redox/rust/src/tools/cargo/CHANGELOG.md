[1c6ec66d...rust-1.40.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/1c6ec66d...rust-1.40.0)

### Added
- (Nightly only): The `mtime-on-use` feature may now be enabled via the
  `unstable.mtime_on_use` config option.
  [#7411](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7411)
- Added `http.ssl-version` config option to control the version of TLS,
  along with min/max versions.
  [#7308](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7308)
- (Nightly only): Added support for named profiles.
  [#6989](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6989)
- ðŸ”¥ Compiler warnings are now cached on disk. If a build generates warnings,
  re-running the build will now re-display the warnings.
  [#7450](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7450)
- (Nightly only): Added `-Zpanic-abort-tests` to allow building and running
  tests with the "abort" panic strategy.
  [#7460](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7460)
- Added `--filter-platform` option to `cargo metadata` to narrow the nodes
  shown in the resolver graph to only packages included for the given target
  triple.
  [#7376](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7376)

### Changed
- Cargo's "platform" `cfg` parsing has been extracted into a separate crate
  named `cargo-platform`.
  [#7375](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7375)
- (Nightly only): Changed `build-std` to use `--sysroot`.
  [#7421](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7421)
- (Nightly only): Various fixes and enhancements to `-Ztimings`.
  [#7395](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7395)
  [#7398](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7398)
  [#7397](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7397)
  [#7403](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7403)
  [#7428](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7428)
  [#7429](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7429)
- Dependencies extracted into Cargo's cache no longer preserve mtimes to
  reduce syscall overhead.
  [#7465](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7465)
- Windows: EXE files no longer include a metadata hash in the filename.
  This helps with debuggers correlating the filename with the PDB file.
  [#7400](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7400)
- Wasm32: `.wasm` files are no longer treated as an "executable", allowing
  `cargo test` and `cargo run` to work properly with the generated `.js` file.
  [#7476](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7476)
- crates.io now supports SPDX 3.6 licenses.
  [#7481](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7481)
- Improved cyclic dependency error message.
  [#7470](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7470)
- Bare `cargo clean` no longer locks the package cache.
  [#7502](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7502)
- `cargo publish` now allows dev-dependencies without a version key to be
  published. A git or path-only dev-dependency will be removed from the
  package manifest before uploading.
  [#7333](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7333)
- (Nightly only): Profile overrides have renamed the syntax to be
  `[profile.dev.package.NAME]`.
  [#7504](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7504)
- `--features` and `--no-default-features` in the root of a virtual workspace
  will now generate an error instead of being ignored.
  [#7507](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7507)
- Generated files (like `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`) in a package archive
  now have their timestamp set to the current time instead of the epoch.
  [#7523](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7523)
- The `-Z` flag parser is now more strict, rejecting more invalid syntax.
  [#7531](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7531)

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where if a package had an `include` field, and `Cargo.lock`
  in `.gitignore`, and a binary or example target, and the `Cargo.lock` exists
  in the current project, it would fail to publish complaining the
  `Cargo.lock` was dirty.
  [#7448](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7448)
- Fixed a panic in a particular combination of `[patch]` entries.
  [#7452](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7452)
- Windows: Better error message when `cargo test` or `rustc` crashes in an
  abnormal way, such as a signal or seg fault.
  [#7535](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7535)
- (Nightly only): Fixed warnings for unused profile overrides in a workspace.
  [#7536](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7536)

## Cargo 1.39 (2019-11-07)
[e853aa97...1c6ec66d](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/e853aa97...1c6ec66d)

### Added
- Config files may now use the `.toml` filename extension.
  [#7295](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7295)
- (Nightly only): Basic support for building the standard library directly
  from Cargo has been added.
  ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std))
  [#7216](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7216)
- The `--workspace` flag has been added as an alias for `--all` to help avoid
  confusion about the meaning of "all".
  [#7241](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7241)
- The `publish` field has been added to `cargo metadata`.
  [#7354](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7354)
- (Nightly only): Added `-Ztimings` feature to generate an HTML report
  on the time spent on individual compilation steps. This also may output
  completion steps on the console and JSON data.
  ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#timings))
  [#7311](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7311)
- (Nightly only): Added ability to cross-compile doctests.
  ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#doctest-xcompile))
  [#6892](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6892)

### Changed
- Display more information if parsing the output from `rustc` fails.
  [#7236](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7236)
- TOML errors now show the column number.
  [#7248](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7248)
- `cargo vendor` no longer deletes files in the `vendor` directory that starts
  with a `.`.
  [#7242](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7242)
- `cargo fetch` will now show manifest warnings.
  [#7243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7243)
- `cargo publish` will now check git submodules if they contain any
  uncommitted changes.
  [#7245](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7245)
- In a build script, `cargo:rustc-flags` now allows `-l` and `-L` flags
  without spaces.
  [#7257](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7257)
- When `cargo install` replaces an older version of a package it will now
  delete any installed binaries that are no longer present in the newly
  installed version.
  [#7246](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7246)
- A git dependency may now also specify a `version` key when published. The
  `git` value will be stripped from the uploaded crate, matching the behavior
  of `path` dependencies.
  [#7237](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7237)
- The behavior of workspace default-members has changed. The default-members
  now only applies when running Cargo in the root of the workspace. Previously
  it would always apply regardless of which directory Cargo is running in.
  [#7270](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7270)
- libgit2 updated pulling in all upstream changes.
  [#7275](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7275)
- Bump `home` dependency for locating home directories.
  [#7277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7277)
- zsh completions have been updated.
  [#7296](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7296)
- SSL connect errors are now retried.
  [#7318](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7318)
- The jobserver has been changed to acquire N tokens (instead of N-1), and
  then immediately acquires the extra token. This was changed to accommodate
  the `cc` crate on Windows to allow it to release its implicit token.
  [#7344](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7344)
- The scheduling algorithm for choosing which crate to build next has been
  changed. It now chooses the crate with the greatest number of transitive
  crates waiting on it. Previously it used a maximum topological depth.
  [#7390](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7390)
- RUSTFLAGS are no longer incorporated in the metadata and filename hash,
  reversing the change from 1.33 that added it. This means that any change to
  RUSTFLAGS will cause a recompile, and will not affect symbol munging.
  [#7459](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7459)

### Fixed
- Git dependencies with submodules with shorthand SSH URLs (like
  `git@github.com/user/repo.git`) should now work.
  [#7238](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7238)
- Handle broken symlinks when creating `.dSYM` symlinks on macOS.
  [#7268](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7268)
- Fixed issues with multiple versions of the same crate in a `[patch]` table.
  [#7303](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7303)
- Fixed issue with custom target `.json` files where a substring of the name
  matches an unsupported crate type (like "bin").
  [#7363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7363)
- Fixed issues with generating documentation for proc-macro crate types.
  [#7159](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7159)
- Fixed hang if Cargo panics within a build thread.
  [#7366](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7366)
- Fixed rebuild detection if a `build.rs` script issues different `rerun-if`
  directives between builds. Cargo was erroneously causing a rebuild after the
  change.
  [#7373](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7373)
- Properly handle canonical URLs for `[patch]` table entries, preventing
  the patch from working after the first time it is used.
  [#7368](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7368)
- Fixed an issue where integration tests were waiting for the package binary
  to finish building before starting their own build. They now may build
  concurrently.
  [#7394](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7394)
- Fixed accidental change in the previous release on how `--features a b` flag
  is interpreted, restoring the original behavior where this is interpreted as
  `--features a` along with the argument `b` passed to the command. To pass
  multiple features, use quotes around the features to pass multiple features
  like `--features "a b"`, or use commas, or use multiple `--features` flags.
  [#7419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7419)

## Cargo 1.38 (2019-09-26)
[4c1fa54d...23ef9a4e](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/4c1fa54d...23ef9a4e)

### Added

- ðŸ”¥ Cargo build pipelining has been enabled by default to leverage more idle CPU
  parallelism during builds.
  [#7143](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7143)
- The `--message-format` option to Cargo can now be specified multiple times and
  accepts a comma-separated list of values. In addition to the previous values
  it also now accepts `json-diagnostic-short` and
  `json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi` which configures the output coming from rustc
  in `json` message mode.
  [#7214](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7214)
- Cirrus CI badges are now supported on crates.io.
  [#7119](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7119)
- (Nightly only): Added `cargo fix --clippy` which will apply
  machine-applicable fixes from Clippy.
  [#7069](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7069)
- A new format for `Cargo.lock` has been introduced. This new format is
  intended to avoid source-control merge conflicts more often, and to
  generally make it safer to merge changes. This new format is *not* enabled
  at this time, though Cargo will use it if it sees it. At some point in the
  future, it is intended that this will become the default.
  [#7070](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7070)
- Progress bar support added for FreeBSD.
  [#7222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7222)
- (Nightly only): Added `-Z binary-dep-depinfo` flag to add change tracking
  for binary dependencies like the standard library.
  [#7137](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7137)
  [#7219](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7219)

### Changed
- The `-q` flag will no longer suppress the root error message for an error
  from Cargo itself.
  [#7116](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7116)
- The Cargo Book is now published with mdbook 0.3 providing a number of
  formatting fixes and improvements.
  [#7140](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7140)
- The `--features` command-line flag can now be specified multiple times.
  The list of features from all the flags are joined together.
  [#7084](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7084)
- (Nightly only): `cargo clippy-preview` will always run, even if no changes
  have been made.
  [#7157](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7157)
- Package include/exclude glob-vs-gitignore warnings have been removed.
  Packages may now use gitignore-style matching without producing any
  warnings.
  [#7170](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7170)
- Cargo now shows the command and output when parsing `rustc` output fails
  when querying `rustc` for information like `cfg` values.
  [#7185](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7185)
- `cargo package`/`cargo publish` now allows a symbolic link to a git
  submodule to include that submodule.
  [#6817](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6817)
- Improved the error message when a version requirement does not
  match any versions, but there are pre-release versions available.
  [#7191](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7191)

### Fixed
- (Nightly only): Fixed exponential blowup when using `CARGO_BUILD_PIPELINING`.
  [#7062](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7062)
- Fixed using the wrong directory when updating git repositories when using
  the `git-fetch-with-cli` config option, and the `GIT_DIR` environment
  variable is set. This may happen when running cargo from git callbacks.
  [#7082](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7082)
- Fixed dep-info files being overwritten for targets that have separate debug
  outputs. For example, binaries on `-apple-` targets with `.dSYM` directories
  would overwrite the `.d` file.
  [#7057](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7057)
- Fix `[patch]` table not preserving "one major version per source" rule.
  [#7118](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7118)
- Ignore `--remap-path-prefix` flags for the metadata hash in the `cargo
  rustc` command. This was causing the remap settings to inadvertently affect
  symbol names.
  [#7134](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7134)
- Fixed cycle detection in `[patch]` dependencies.
  [#7174](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7174)
- Fixed `cargo new` leaving behind a symlink on Windows when `core.symlinks`
  git config is true. Also adds a number of fixes and updates from upstream
  libgit2.
  [#7176](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7176)
- macOS: Fixed setting the flag to mark the `target` directory to be excluded
  from backups.
  [#7192](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7192)
- Fixed `cargo fix` panicking under some situations involving multi-byte
  characters.
  [#7221](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7221)
- (Nightly only): Fixed passing args to clippy in `cargo clippy-preview`.
  [#7162](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7162)

## Cargo 1.37 (2019-08-15)
[c4fcfb72...9edd0891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/c4fcfb72...9edd0891)

### Added
- Added `doctest` field to `cargo metadata` to determine if a target's
  documentation is tested.
  [#6953](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6953)
  [#6965](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6965)
- (Nightly only): Added [compiler message
  caching](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#cache-messages).
  The `-Z cache-messages` flag makes cargo cache the compiler output so that
  future runs can redisplay previous warnings.
  [#6933](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6933)
- ðŸ”¥ The [`cargo
  vendor`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-vendor.html)
  command is now built-in to Cargo. This command may be used to create a local
  copy of the sources of all dependencies.
  [#6869](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6869)
- ðŸ”¥ The "publish lockfile" feature is now stable. This feature will
  automatically include the `Cargo.lock` file when a package is published if
  it contains a binary executable target. By default, Cargo will ignore
  `Cargo.lock` when installing a package. To force Cargo to use the
  `Cargo.lock` file included in the published package, use `cargo install
  --locked`. This may be useful to ensure that `cargo install` consistently
  reproduces the same result. It may also be useful when a semver-incompatible
  change is accidentally published to a dependency, providing a way to fall
  back to a version that is known to work.
  [#7026](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7026)
- ðŸ”¥ The `default-run` feature has been stabilized. This feature allows you to
  specify which binary executable to run by default with `cargo run` when a
  package includes multiple binaries. Set the `default-run` key in the
  `[package]` table in `Cargo.toml` to the name of the binary to use by
  default.
  [#7056](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7056)

### Changed
- `cargo package` now verifies that build scripts do not create empty
  directories.
  [#6973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6973)
- A warning is now issued if `cargo doc` generates duplicate outputs, which
  causes files to be randomly stomped on. This may happen for a variety of
  reasons (renamed dependencies, multiple versions of the same package,
  packages with renamed libraries, etc.). This is a known bug, which needs
  more work to handle correctly.
  [#6998](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6998)
- Enabling a dependency's feature with `--features foo/bar` will no longer
  compile the current crate with the `foo` feature if `foo` is not an optional
  dependency.
  [#7010](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7010)
- If `--remap-path-prefix` is passed via RUSTFLAGS, it will no longer affect
  the filename metadata hash.
  [#6966](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6966)
- libgit2 has been updated to 0.28.2, which Cargo uses to access git
  repositories. This brings in hundreds of changes and fixes since it was last
  updated in November.
  [#7018](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7018)
- Cargo now supports absolute paths in the dep-info files generated by rustc.
  This is laying the groundwork for [tracking
  binaries](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/61727), such as libstd, for
  rebuild detection. (Note: this contains a known bug.)
  [#7030](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7030)
- (Nightly only): `-Z mtime-on-use` no longer touches intermediate artifacts.
  [#7050](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7050)

### Fixed
- Fixed how zsh completions fetch the list of commands.
  [#6956](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6956)
- "+ debuginfo" is no longer printed in the build summary when `debug` is set
  to 0.
  [#6971](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6971)
- Fixed `cargo doc` with an example configured with `doc = true` to document
  correctly.
  [#7023](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7023)
- Don't fail if a read-only lock cannot be acquired in CARGO_HOME. This helps
  when CARGO_HOME doesn't exist, but `--locked` is used which means CARGO_HOME
  is not needed.
  [#7149](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7149)
- Reverted a change in 1.35 which released jobserver tokens when Cargo blocked
  on a lock file. It caused a deadlock in some situations.
  [#7204](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7204)

## Cargo 1.36 (2019-07-04)
[6f3e9c36...c4fcfb72](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/6f3e9c36...c4fcfb72)

### Added
- (Nightly only): Added [`-Z install-upgrade`
  feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#install-upgrade)
  to track details about installed crates and to update them if they are
  out-of-date. [#6798](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6798)
- (Nightly only): Added the [`public-dependency`
  feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#public-dependency)
  which allows tracking public versus private dependencies.
  [#6772](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6772)
- Added more detailed documentation on target auto-discovery.
  [#6898](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6898)
- (Nightly only): Added build pipelining via the `build.pipelining` config
  option (`CARGO_BUILD_PIPELINING` env var).
  [#6883](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6883)
- ðŸ”¥ Stabilize the `--offline` flag which allows using cargo without a network
  connection.
  [#6934](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6934)
  [#6871](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6871)

### Changed
- `publish = ["crates-io"]` may be added to the manifest to restrict
  publishing to crates.io only.
  [#6838](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6838)
- macOS: Only include the default paths if `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` is not
  set. Also, remove `/lib` from the default set.
  [#6856](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6856)
- `cargo publish` will now exit early if the login token is not available.
  [#6854](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6854)
- HTTP/2 stream errors are now considered "spurious" and will cause a retry.
  [#6861](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6861)
- (Nightly only): The `publish-lockfile` feature has had some significant
  changes. The default is now `true`, the `Cargo.lock` will always be
  published for binary crates. The `Cargo.lock` is now regenerated during
  publishing. `cargo install` now ignores the `Cargo.lock` file by default,
  and requires `--locked` to use the lock file. Warnings have been added if
  yanked dependencies are detected.
  [#6840](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6840)
- Setting a feature on a dependency where that feature points to a *required*
  dependency is now an error. Previously it was a warning.
  [#6860](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6860)
- The `registry.index` config value now supports relative `file:` URLs.
  [#6873](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6873)
- macOS: The `.dSYM` directory is now symbolically linked next to example
  binaries without the metadata hash so that debuggers can find it.
  [#6891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6891)
- The default `Cargo.toml` template for now projects now includes a comment
  providing a link to the documentation.
  [#6881](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6881)
- Some improvements to the wording of the crate download summary.
  [#6916](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6916)
  [#6920](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6920)
- âœ¨ Changed `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `CARGO_LOG` so that user code
  that uses the `log` crate will not display cargo's debug output.
  [#6918](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6918)
- `Cargo.toml` is now always included when packaging, even if it is not listed
  in `package.include`.
  [#6925](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6925)
- Package include/exclude values now use gitignore patterns instead of glob
  patterns. [#6924](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6924)

### Performance
- Resolver performance improvements for some cases.
  [#6853](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6853)
- Optimized how cargo reads the index JSON files by caching the results.
  [#6880](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6880)
  [#6912](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6912)
  [#6940](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6940)
- Various performance improvements.
  [#6867](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6867)

- `cargo run` now correctly passes non-UTF8 arguments to the child process.
  [#6849](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6849)

### Added
- Added the `rustc-cdylib-link-arg` key for build scripts to specify linker
  arguments for cdylib crates.
  [#6298](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6298)
- (Nightly only): `cargo clippy-preview` is now a built-in cargo command.
  [#6759](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6759)

### Changed
- When passing a test filter, such as `cargo test foo`, don't build examples
  (unless they set `test = true`).
  [#6683](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6683)
- Forward the `--quiet` flag from `cargo test` to the libtest harness so that
  tests are actually quiet.
  [#6358](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6358)
- The verification step in `cargo package` that checks if any files are
  modified is now stricter. It uses a hash of the contents instead of checking
  filesystem mtimes. It also checks *all* files in the package.
  [#6740](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6740)
- Jobserver tokens are now released whenever Cargo blocks on a file lock.
  [#6748](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6748)

  table headers with the same name.
  [#6761](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6761)
- Removed the `CARGO_PKG_*` environment variables from the metadata hash and
  added them to the fingerprint instead. This means that when these values
  change, stale artifacts are not left behind. Also added the "repository"
  value to the fingerprint.
  [#6785](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6785)
- `cargo metadata` no longer shows a `null` field for a dependency without a
  library in `resolve.nodes.deps`. The dependency is no longer shown.
  [#6534](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6534)
- `cargo new` will no longer include an email address in the `authors` field
  if it is set to the empty string.
  [#6802](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6802)
- `cargo doc --open` now works when documenting multiple packages.
  [#6803](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6803)
- `cargo install --path P` now loads the `.cargo/config` file from the
  directory P. [#6805](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6805)
- Using semver metadata in a version requirement (such as `1.0.0+1234`) now
  issues a warning that it is ignored.
  [#6806](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6806)
- `cargo install` now rejects certain combinations of flags where some flags
  would have been ignored.
  [#6801](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6801)
- (Nightly only): The `build-override` profile setting now includes
  proc-macros and their dependencies.
  [#6811](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6811)
- Resolver performance improvements for some cases.
  [#6776](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6776)
- (Nightly only): Optional and target dependencies now work better with `-Z
  offline`. [#6814](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6814)

### Fixed
- Fixed running separate commands (such as `cargo build` then `cargo test`)
  where the second command could use stale results from a build script.
  [#6720](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6720)
- Fixed `cargo fix` not working properly if a `.gitignore` file that matched
  the root package directory.
  [#6767](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6767)
- Fixed accidentally compiling a lib multiple times if `panic=unwind` was set
  in a profile. [#6781](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6781)
- Paths to JSON files in `build.target` config value are now canonicalized to
  fix building dependencies.
  [#6778](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6778)
- Fixed re-running a build script if its compilation was interrupted (such as
  if it is killed). [#6782](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6782)
- Fixed `cargo new` initializing a fossil repo.
  [#6792](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6792)
- Fixed supporting updating a git repo that has a force push when using the
  `git-fetch-with-cli` feature. `git-fetch-with-cli` also shows more error
  information now when it fails.
  [#6800](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6800)
- `--example` binaries built for the WASM target are fixed to no longer
  include a metadata hash in the filename, and are correctly emitted in the
  `compiler-artifact` JSON message.
  [#6812](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6812)

## Cargo 1.34 (2019-04-11)
[f099fe94...6789d8a0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/f099fe94...6789d8a0)

### Added
- ðŸ”¥ Stabilized support for [alternate
  registries](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.34.0/cargo/reference/registries.html).
  [#6654](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6654)
- (Nightly only): Added `-Z mtime-on-use` flag to cause the mtime to be
  updated on the filesystem when a crate is used. This is intended to be able
  to track stale artifacts in the future for cleaning up unused files.
  [#6477](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6477)
  [#6573](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6573)
- Added documentation on using builds.sr.ht Continuous Integration with Cargo.
  [#6565](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6565)

  macros for both the host and the target.
  [#6547](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6547)
- Added a warning if `--exclude` flag specifies an unknown package.
  [#6679](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6679)

### Changed
- `cargo test --doc --no-run` doesn't do anything, so it now displays an error
  to that effect. [#6628](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6628)
- Various updates to bash completion: add missing options and commands,
  support libtest completions, use rustup for `--target` completion, fallback
  to filename completion, fix editing the command line.
  [#6644](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6644)
- Publishing a crate with a `[patch]` section no longer generates an error.
  The `[patch]` section is removed from the manifest before publishing.
  [#6535](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6535)
- `build.incremental = true` config value is now treated the same as
  `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`, previously it was ignored.
  [#6688](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6688)
- Errors from a registry are now always displayed regardless of the HTTP
  response code. [#6771](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6771)

### Fixed
- Fixed bash completion for `cargo run --example`.
  [#6578](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6578)

  credentials. [#6681](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6681)
- Fixed resolving yanked crates with a local registry.
  [#6750](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6750)

## Cargo 1.33 (2019-02-28)
[8610973a...f099fe94](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/8610973a...f099fe94)

### Added

  includes the path to the executable that was built.
  [#6363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6363)
- The man pages have been rewritten, and are now published with the web
  documentation. [#6405](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6405)
- (Nightly only): Allow using registry *names* in `[patch]` tables instead of
  just URLs. [#6456](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6456)
- `cargo login` now displays a confirmation after saving the token.
  [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
- A warning is now emitted if a `[patch]` entry does not match any package.
  [#6470](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6470)
- `cargo metadata` now includes the `links` key for a package.
  [#6480](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6480)
- (Nightly only): `cargo metadata` added the `registry` key for dependencies.
  [#6500](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6500)
- "Very verbose" output with `-vv` now displays the environment variables that
  cargo sets when it runs a process.
  [#6492](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6492)
- `--example`, `--bin`, `--bench`, or `--test` without an argument now lists
  the available targets for those options.
  [#6505](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6505)
- Windows: If a process fails with an extended status exit code, a
  human-readable name for the code is now displayed.
  [#6532](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6532)
- Added `--features`, `--no-default-features`, and `--all-features` flags to
  the `cargo package` and `cargo publish` commands to use the given features
  when verifying the package.
  [#6453](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6453)

### Changed
- If `cargo fix` fails to compile the fixed code, the rustc errors are now
  displayed on the console.
  [#6419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6419)
- (Nightly only): Registry names are now restricted to the same style as
  package names (alphanumeric, `-` and `_` characters).
  [#6469](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6469)
- (Nightly only): `cargo login` now displays the `/me` URL from the registry
  config. [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
- Hide the `--host` flag from `cargo login`, it is unused.
  [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
- (Nightly only): `cargo login --registry=NAME` now supports interactive input
  for the token. [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
- (Nightly only): Registries may now elide the `api` key from `config.json` to
  indicate they do not support API access.
  [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
- Build script fingerprints now include the rustc version.
  [#6473](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6473)
- macOS: Switched to setting `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` instead of
  `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. [#6355](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6355)
- `RUSTFLAGS` is now included in the metadata hash, meaning that changing
  the flags will not overwrite previously built files.
  [#6503](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6503)
- When updating the crate graph, unrelated yanked crates were erroneously
  removed. They are now kept at their original version if possible. This was
  causing unrelated packages to be downgraded during `cargo update -p
  somecrate`. [#5702](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5702)
- TOML files now support the [0.5 TOML
  syntax](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#050--2018-07-11).

### Fixed
- `cargo fix` will now ignore suggestions that modify multiple files.
  [#6402](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6402)
- `cargo fix` will now only fix one target at a time, to deal with targets
  which share the same source files.

- `cargo init` will now avoid creating duplicate entries in `.gitignore`
  files. [#6521](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6521)
- (Nightly only): Fixed detection of publishing to crates.io when using
  alternate registries. [#6525](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6525)
- Builds now attempt to detect if a file is modified in the middle of a
  compilation, allowing you to build again and pick up the new changes. This
  is done by keeping track of when the compilation *starts* not when it
  finishes. Also, [#5919](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5919) was
  reverted, meaning that cargo does *not* treat equal filesystem mtimes as
  requiring a rebuild. [#6484](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6484)

  to the documentation. [#6321](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6321)
- Added the alias `c` for `cargo check`.
  [#6218](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6218)
- (Nightly only): Added `"compile_mode"` key to the build-plan JSON structure
  to be able to distinguish running a custom build script versus compiling the
  build script. [#6331](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6331)

### Changed
- ðŸ”¥ HTTP/2 multiplexing is now enabled by default. The `http.multiplexing`
  config value may be used to disable it.
  [#6271](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6271)
- Use ANSI escape sequences to clear lines instead of spaces.
  [#6233](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6233)
- Disable git templates when checking out git dependencies, which can cause
  problems. [#6252](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6252)
- Include the `--update-head-ok` git flag when using the
  `net.git-fetch-with-cli` option. This can help prevent failures when
  fetching some repositories.
  [#6250](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6250)
- When extracting a crate during the verification step of `cargo package`, the
  filesystem mtimes are no longer set, which was failing on some rare
  filesystems. [#6257](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6257)
- `crate-type = ["proc-macro"]` is now treated the same as `proc-macro = true`
  in `Cargo.toml`. [#6256](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6256)

  set in a virtual workspace. Warnings are displayed if `replace` or `patch`
  is used in a workspace member.
  [#6276](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6276)
- Improved performance of the resolver in some cases.
  [#6283](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6283)
  [#6366](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6366)
- `.rmeta` files are no longer hard-linked into the base target directory
  (`target/debug`). [#6292](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6292)
- A warning is issued if multiple targets are built with the same output
  filenames. [#6308](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6308)
- When using `cargo build` (without `--release`) benchmarks are now built
  using the "test" profile instead of "bench". This makes it easier to debug
  benchmarks, and avoids confusing behavior.
  [#6309](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6309)
- User aliases may now override built-in aliases (`b`, `r`, `t`, and `c`).
  [#6259](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6259)

  [#6255](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6255)
- `cargo clean --release` now only deletes the release directory.
  [#6349](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6349)

### Fixed
- Avoid adding extra angle brackets in email address for `cargo new`.
  [#6243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6243)
- The progress bar is disabled if the CI environment variable is set.
  [#6281](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6281)
- Avoid retaining all rustc output in memory.
  [#6289](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6289)
- If JSON parsing fails, and rustc exits nonzero, don't lose the parse failure
  message. [#6290](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6290)
- (Nightly only): `--out-dir` no longer copies over build scripts.
  [#6300](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6300)

  `--allow-dirty` now completely disables the git repo checks.
  [#6280](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6280)
- Fixed build change tracking for `[patch]` deps which resulted in `cargo
  build` rebuilding when it shouldn't.

  [#5995](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5995/)
- Added `resolve.nodes.deps` key to `cargo metadata`, which includes more
  information about resolved dependencies, and properly handles renamed
  dependencies. [#5871](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5871)
- When creating a package, provide more detail with `-v` when failing to
  discover if files are dirty in a git repository. Also fix a problem with
  discovery on Windows. [#5858](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5858)
- Filters like `--bin`, `--test`, `--example`, `--bench`, or `--lib` can be
  used in a workspace without selecting a specific package.
  [#5873](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5873)
- `cargo run` can be used in a workspace without selecting a specific package.
  [#5877](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5877)
- `cargo doc --message-format=json` now outputs JSON messages from rustdoc.
  [#5878](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5878)
- Added `--message-format=short` to show one-line messages.
  [#5879](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5879)
- Added `.cargo_vcs_info.json` file to `.crate` packages that captures the
  current git hash. [#5886](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5886)
- Added `net.git-fetch-with-cli` configuration option to use the `git`
  executable to fetch repositories instead of using the built-in libgit2
  library. [#5914](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5914)
- Added `required-features` to `cargo metadata`.
  [#5902](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5902)

  [#5927](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5927)
- (Nightly only): Added
  [metabuild](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.30.0/cargo/reference/unstable.html#metabuild).
  [#5628](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5628)
- Added `--allow-staged` flag to `cargo fix` to allow it to run if files are
  staged in git. [#5943](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5943)
- Added `net.low-speed-limit` config value, and also honor `net.timeout` for
  http operations. [#5957](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5957)
- Added `--edition` flag to `cargo new`.
  [#5984](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5984)
- Temporarily stabilized 2018 edition support for the duration of the beta.
  [#5984](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5984)
  [#5989](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5989)
- Added support for `target.'cfg(â€¦)'.runner` config value to specify the
  run/test/bench runner for config-expressioned targets.
  [#5959](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5959)

### Changed
- Windows: `cargo run` will not kill child processes when the main process
  exits. [#5887](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5887)
- Switched to the `opener` crate to open a web browser with `cargo doc
  --open`. This should more reliably select the system-preferred browser on
  all platforms. [#5888](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5888)
- Equal file mtimes now cause a target to be rebuilt. Previously only if files
  were strictly *newer* than the last build would it cause a rebuild.
  [#5919](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5919)
- Ignore `build.target` config value when running `cargo install`.
  [#5874](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5874)
- Ignore `RUSTC_WRAPPER` for `cargo fix`.
  [#5983](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5983)
- Ignore empty `RUSTC_WRAPPER`.

### Fixed
- Fixed error when creating a package with an edition field in `Cargo.toml`.
  [#5908](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5908)

  [#5935](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5935)
- `cargo fix` now always runs, even if it was run previously.
  [#5944](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5944)
- Windows: Attempt to more reliably detect terminal width. msys-based
  terminals are forced to 60 characters wide.
  [#6010](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6010)
- Allow multiple target flags with `cargo doc --document-private-items`.
