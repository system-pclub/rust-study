//! # Feature gating
//!
//! This module implements the gating necessary for preventing certain compiler
//! features from being used by default. This module will crawl a pre-expanded
//! AST to ensure that there are no features which are used that are not
//! enabled.
//!
//! Features are enabled in programs via the crate-level attributes of
//! `#![feature(...)]` with a comma-separated list of features.
//!
//! For the purpose of future feature-tracking, once code for detection of feature
//! gate usage is added, *do not remove it again* even once the feature
//! becomes stable.
