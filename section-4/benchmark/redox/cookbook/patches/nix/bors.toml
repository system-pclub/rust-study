# Set bors's timeout to 4 hours
#
# bors's timeout should always be twice a long as the test suite takes.
# This is to allow Travis to fast-fail a test; if one of the builders
# immediately reports a failure, then bors will move on to the next batch,
# leaving the slower builders to work through the already-doomed run and
# the next one.
#
# At the time this was written, nix's test suite took about an hour to run.
# The timeout was raised to four hours, instead of two, to give nix room
# to grow and time for delays on Travis's end.
