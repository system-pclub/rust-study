This is a low level library, if you are looking for something easier to get
started with, see [Tokio](https://tokio.rs).

## Usage

To use `mio`, first add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
mio = "0.6"
```

Then, add this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate mio;
```

## Features

* Non-blocking TCP, UDP.
* I/O event notification queue backed by epoll, kqueue, and IOCP.
* Zero allocations at runtime
* Platform specific extensions.

## Non-goals

The following are specifically omitted from Mio and are left to the user
or higher-level libraries.

* Timers

## Platforms

Currently supported platforms:
