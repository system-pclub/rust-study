//! An implementation of the GNU make jobserver.
//!
//! This crate is an implementation, in Rust, of the GNU `make` jobserver for
//! CLI tools that are interoperating with make or otherwise require some form
//! of parallelism limiting across process boundaries. This was originally
//! written for usage in Cargo to both (a) work when `cargo` is invoked from
//! `make` (using `make`'s jobserver) and (b) work when `cargo` invokes build
//! scripts, exporting a jobserver implementation for `make` processes to
//! transitively use.
//!
//! The jobserver implementation can be found in [detail online][docs] but
//! basically boils down to a cross-process semaphore. On Unix this is
//! implemented with the `pipe` syscall and read/write ends of a pipe and on
//! Windows this is implemented literally with IPC semaphores.
//!
//! The jobserver protocol in `make` also dictates when tokens are acquire to
//! run child work, and clients using this crate should take care to implement
//! such details to ensure correct interoperation with `make` itself.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! Connect to a jobserver that was set up by `make` or a different process:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use jobserver::Client;
//!
//! // See API documentation for why this is `unsafe`
//! let client = match unsafe { Client::from_env() } {
//!     Some(client) => client,
//!     None => panic!("client not configured"),
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! Acquire and release token from a jobserver:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use jobserver::Client;
//!
//! let client = unsafe { Client::from_env().unwrap() };
//! let token = client.acquire().unwrap(); // blocks until it is available
//! drop(token); // releases the token when the work is done
//! ```
//!
//! Create a new jobserver and configure a child process to have access:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::process::Command;
//! use jobserver::Client;
//!
//! let client = Client::new(4).expect("failed to create jobserver");
//! let mut cmd = Command::new("make");
//! client.configure(&mut cmd);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Caveats
//!
//! This crate makes no attempt to release tokens back to a jobserver on
//! abnormal exit of a process. If a process which acquires a token is killed
//! with ctrl-c or some similar signal then tokens will not be released and the
//! jobserver may be in a corrupt state.
//!
//! Note that this is typically ok as ctrl-c means that an entire build process
//! is being torn down, but it's worth being aware of at least!
//!
//! ## Windows caveats
//!
//! There appear to be two implementations of `make` on Windows. On MSYS2 one
//! typically comes as `mingw32-make` and the other as `make` itself. I'm not
//! personally too familiar with what's going on here, but for jobserver-related
//! information the `mingw32-make` implementation uses Windows semaphores
//! whereas the `make` program does not. The `make` program appears to use file
//! descriptors and I'm not really sure how it works, so this crate is not
//! compatible with `make` on Windows. It is, however, compatible with
//! `mingw32-make`.

    ///
    /// Unfortunately the blocking in `acquire` happens at the implementation
    /// layer of jobservers. On Unix this requires a blocking call to `read`
    /// and on Windows this requires one of the `WaitFor*` functions. Both
    /// of these situations aren't the easiest to deal with:
    ///
    /// * On Unix there's basically only one way to wake up a `read` early, and
    ///   that's through a signal. This is what the `make` implementation
    ///   itself uses, relying on `SIGCHLD` to wake up a blocking acquisition
    ///   of a new job token. Unfortunately nonblocking I/O is not an option
    ///   here, so it means that "waiting for one of two events" means that
    ///   the latter event must generate a signal! This is not always the case
    ///   on unix for all jobservers.
    ///
    /// * On Windows you'd have to basically use the `WaitForMultipleObjects`
    ///   which means that you've got to canonicalize all your event sources
    ///   into a `HANDLE` which also isn't the easiest thing to do
    ///   unfortunately.
    ///
    /// This function essentially attempts to ease these limitations by
    /// converting this `Client` into a helper thread spawned into this
    /// process. The application can then request that the helper thread
    /// acquires tokens and the provided closure will be invoked for each token
    /// acquired.
    ///
    /// The intention is that this function can be used to translate the event
    /// of a token acquisition into an arbitrary user-defined event.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// This function will consume the `Client` provided to be transferred to
    /// the helper thread that is spawned. Additionally a closure `f` is
    /// provided to be invoked whenever a token is acquired.
    ///
    /// This closure is only invoked after calls to
    /// `HelperThread::request_token` have been made and a token itself has
    /// been acquired. If an error happens while acquiring the token then
    /// an error will be yielded to the closure as well.
    ///
    /// # Return Value
    ///
    /// This function will return an instance of the `HelperThread` structure
    /// which is used to manage the helper thread associated with this client.
    /// Through the `HelperThread` you'll request that tokens are acquired.
    /// When acquired, the closure provided here is invoked.
    ///
    /// When the `HelperThread` structure is returned it will be gracefully
    /// torn down, and the calling thread will be blocked until the thread is
    /// torn down (which should be prompt).
