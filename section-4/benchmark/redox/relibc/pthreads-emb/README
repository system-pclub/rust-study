POSIX Threads for embedded systems (PTE)

PTE is an open source implementation of the POSIX API for multithreaded 
applications (pthreads).  It is intended to be used to provide a pthreads 
API for embedded operating systems that do not natively provide a pthreads 
API. PTE is designed to be easily portable to such operating systems and only 
relies on basic primitives (e.g. semaphores) that are widely supported on most 
embedded operating systems.

Currently, PTE has been ported to Texas Instrument's DSP/BIOS and Sony's PSP OS.

PTE is based heavily on Pthreads Win32, an implementation of pthreads 
for Windows.
