    /*
     * Purpose:
     *      This structure creates an association between a thread and a key.
     *      It is used to implement the implicit invocation of a user defined
     *      destroy routine for thread specific data registered by a user upon
     *      exiting a thread.
     *
     *      Graphically, the arrangement is as follows, where:
     *
     *         K - Key with destructor
     *            (head of chain is key->threads)
     *         T - Thread that has called pthread_setspecific(Kn)
     *            (head of chain is thread->keys)
     *         A - Association. Each association is a node at the
     *             intersection of two doubly-linked lists.
     *
     *                 T1    T2    T3
     *                 |     |     |
     *                 |     |     |
     *         K1 -----+-----A-----A----->
     *                 |     |     |
     *                 |     |     |
     *         K2 -----A-----A-----+----->
     *                 |     |     |
     *                 |     |     |
     *         K3 -----A-----+-----A----->
     *                 |     |     |
     *                 |     |     |
     *                 V     V     V
     *
     *      Access to the association is guarded by two locks: the key's
     *      general lock (guarding the row) and the thread's general
     *      lock (guarding the column). This avoids the need for a
     *      dedicated lock for each association, which not only consumes
     *      more handles but requires that: before the lock handle can
     *      be released - both the key must be deleted and the thread
     *      must have called the destructor. The two-lock arrangement
     *      allows the resources to be freed as soon as either thread or
     *      key is concluded.
     *
     *      To avoid deadlock: whenever both locks are required, the key
     *      and thread locks are always acquired in the order: key lock
     *      then thread lock. An exception to this exists when a thread
     *      calls the destructors, however this is done carefully to
     *      avoid deadlock.
     *
     *      An association is created when a thread first calls
     *      pthread_setspecific() on a key that has a specified
     *      destructor.
     *
     *      An association is destroyed either immediately after the
     *      thread calls the key destructor function on thread exit, or
     *      when the key is deleted.
     *
     * Attributes:
     *      thread
     *              reference to the thread that owns the
     *              association. This is actually the pointer to the
     *              thread struct itself. Since the association is
     *              destroyed before the thread exits, this can never
     *              point to a different logical thread to the one that
     *              created the assoc, i.e. after thread struct reuse.
     *
     *      key
     *              reference to the key that owns the association.
     *
     *      nextKey
     *              The pthread_t->keys attribute is the head of a
     *              chain of associations that runs through the nextKey
     *              link. This chain provides the 1 to many relationship
     *              between a pthread_t and all pthread_key_t on which
     *              it called pthread_setspecific.
     *
     *      prevKey
     *              Similarly.
     *
     *      nextThread
     *              The pthread_key_t->threads attribute is the head of
     *              a chain of assoctiations that runs through the
     *              nextThreads link. This chain provides the 1 to many
     *              relationship between a pthread_key_t and all the
     *              PThreads that have called pthread_setspecific for
     *              this pthread_key_t.
     *
     *      prevThread
     *              Similarly.
     *
     * Notes:
     *      1)      As soon as either the key or the thread is no longer
     *              referencing the association, it can be destroyed. The
     *              association will be removed from both chains.
     *
     *      2)      An association is only created by
     *              pthread_setspecific if the user provided a
     *              destroyRoutine when they created the key.
